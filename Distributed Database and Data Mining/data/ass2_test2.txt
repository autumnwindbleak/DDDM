3041 i propose today to prove to you that all this organized and vast criminality springs from what i may be allowed to call a crime against the spirit i mean a doctrine that by denying all spiritual rational or moral values by which nations have tried for thousands of years to improve human conditions aims to plunge humanity back into barbarism no longer the natural and spontaneous barbarism of primitive nations but into a diabolical barbarism conscious of itself and using for its ends all material means put at the disposal of humanity by contemporary science this sin against the spirit is the original sin of national socialism from which all crimes spring this monstrous doctrine is that of racism whether we consider a crime against peace or war crimes we are therefore not faced by an accidental or an occasional criminality that events could explain without justifying it we are in fact faced by systematic criminality which derives directly and of necessity from a monstrous doctrine put into practice with deliberate intent by the masters of nazi germany
3042 a natural consequence of the national socialist doctrine for which man has no intrinsic value unless he serves the german race
3043 the deportation enslavement or mass scale and systematic practice of summary executions abduction of persons following their disappearance torture or inhuman acts inspired by political philosophical racial or religious motives and organized for the purpose of implementing a concerted effort against a civilian population group

3050 we dont make war against any people in particular we are exterminating the bourgeoisie as a class in your investigations dont look for documents and pieces of evidence about what the defendant has done whether in deed or in speaking or acting against soviet authority the first question you should ask him is what class he comes from what are his roots his education his training and his occupation
3051 attempting or conspiring to commit counseling any person to commit aiding or abetting any person in the commission of or being an accessory after the fact in relation to the act
3052 the fact that so many people swallowed the great terror hook line and sinker was probably one of the reasons that the terror succeeded so well in particular the trials would not be so significant had they not received the blessing of some independent foreign commentators these pundits should be held accountable as accomplices in the bloody politics of the purges or at least blamed for the fact that the political assassinations resumed when the first show trial regarding zinoviev in 1936 was given an ill deserved stamp of approval
3053 that the rage and wrath of the masses must be inflamed against them they must be destroyed as a class because they are accursed
3054 to massacre them it was necessary to proclaim that kulaks are not human beings just as the germans proclaimed that jews are not human beings thus did lenin and stalin say kulaks are not human beings
3055 that is exactly how the nazis put the jewish children into the nazi gas chambers you are not allowed to live you are all jews
3056 who has given you the authority to say what is good and what is bad
3057 the right to life to bodily integrity and to the necessary means of existence the right to pursue ones ultimate goal in the path marked out for him by god the right of association and the right to possess and use property
3058 communism teaches and seeks two objectives unrelenting class warfare and the complete eradication of private ownership not secretly or by hidden methods does it do this but publicly openly and by employing any means possible even the most violent to achieve these objectives there is nothing it is afraid to do nothing for which it has respect or reverence when it comes to power it is ferocious in its cruelty and inhumanity the horrible slaughter and destruction through which it has laid waste to vast regions of eastern europe and asia give evidence of this
3059 when in the silence of abjection no sound can be heard save that of the chains of the slave and the voice of the informer when all tremble before the tyrant and it is as dangerous to incur his favor as to merit his displeasure the historian appears entrusted with the vengeance of the people

3067 the terror was government by fear which robespierre theorized as government by virtue invented to destroy the aristocracy it soon became the means to dispose of the wicked and to combat crime it became an integral part of revolution and appeared to be the only means of forming the future citizens of the republic if the republic of free citizens was not yet a possibility it must be because certain individuals corrupted by their past history were not yet pure enough terror became the means by which revolution the history yet to be created would forge the new human beings of the future
3068 to punish the enemies of the fatherland we must find out who they are but we do not want to punish them we want to destroy them
3069 a man who is already lost he has no particular interest no private business no feelings no personal attachments and no property he does not even have a name everything in him is absorbed by one interest to the exclusion of all others by a single thought a single passion revolution in the depths of his being not simply in words but in his actions as well he has broken all links with society and the world of civilization with its laws and conventions with its social etiquette and its moral code the revolutionary is an implacable enemy and he carries on living only so that he can ensure the destruction of society
3070 the revolutionary never enters the political or social world the so called educated world and he lives with faith only in its swift and total destruction no one who feels pity for anything can truly be called a revolutionary
3071 this whole sick society must be divided into several categories in the first category are the people who are to be killed immediately the second should include individuals who are to be allowed to continue living for a while so that by their monstrous acts they merely accelerate the inevitable uprising of the people
3072 a fantasy reenactment of the french revolution that was the beginning of political terrorism as opposed to isolated acts of assassination as a systematic tactic in the modern world thus the populist strategy of mass insurrection from below in conjunction with that of elite terror from above combined in russia to lend further legitimacy to political violence over and above the initial legitimation provided by the western revolutionary tradition from 1789 to 1871
3073 this country in its unparalleled misfortune remains an enigma for students of its history in trying to shed light on the underlying causes of this age old tragedy a specific and always damaging link has emerged between the seizure or maintenance of power and the practice of political murder be it individual or mass real or symbolic this long tradition of murder has doubtless created a collective consciousness that has little hope for a pacified political world
3074 this act as the following century showed was more genuinely revolutionary than the october revolution emancipation shook the millennial foundations of russian life as neither peter nor lenin could shake them the subjection of progress to slavery
3075 the russians including the bolsheviks are all sons of tsarism this has been their culture and their education for centuries they got rid of the tsar but they cannot get rid of tsarism overnight they still wear the uniform of tsarism even if it is back to front the bolsheviks were not ready for a positive administrative revolution what they wanted was a negative revolution whose doctrinal fanaticism meanness of spirit and general lack of culture they could use as a pretext for any number of acts of destruction one thing i hold against them above all is the pleasure they took in murder just like the tsars before them
3076 cruelty has stupefied and tormented me all my life what are the roots of human cruelty i have thought much about this and i still do not understand it in the slightest but now after the terrible madness of the european war and the bloody events of the revolution i am forced to remark that russian cruelty appears not to have evolved at all its forms have remained the same a chronicler from the turn of the seventeenth century recorded that in his day the following tortures were practiced the mouth was filled with gunpowder and then set alight others have their nether regions filled with powder holes were made in womens breasts and ropes passed through the wounds and the women were suspended by the ropes in 1918 and 1919 the same practices were used in the don and the urals men had dynamite placed in their rear and blown up i think the russians have a unique sense of particular cruelty in the same way that the english have a unique sense of humor a cold sort of cruelty that seeks to explore the limits of human resistance to suffering and to study the persistence and stability of life one can sense a diabolical refinement in russian cruelty there is something quite subtle and refined about it this quality cannot fully be explained by words like psychosis or sadism words that in essence explain nothing at all if such acts of cruelty were the expression of the perverse psychology of a few individuals they would not concern us here they would be material for the psychiatrist rather than for the moralist but i am concerned here with human suffering as a collective entertainment who are the more cruel the whites or the reds they are probably equal as they are both russians in any case history answers quite clearly the most cruel is the most active
3077 the burden of aeschylus oresteia is that crime begets crime and violence violence until the first crime in the chain the original sin of the genus is expiated through accumulated suffering in similar fashion it was the blood of august 1914 acting like some curse of the atreidae on the house of modern europe that generated the chain of international and social violence that has dominated the modern age for the violence and carnage of the war were incommensurate with any conceivable gain and for any party the war itself produced the russian revolution and the bolshevik seizure of power
3078 the real cause of the change into a development toward brutality is attributable to the world war when therefore the war broke out and dragged in its train for four years practically the whole of the healthy male population the coarsening tendencies of militarism sank to the very depths of brutality and to a lack of human feeling and sentiment even the proletariat could no longer escape its influence they were to a very high degree infected by militarism and when they returned home again were in every way brutalized habituated to war the man who had come back from the front was only too often in a state of mind and feeling that made him ready even in peacetime and among his own people to enforce his claims and interests by deeds of violence and bloodshed that became as it were an element of the civil war
3079 war is waged by regimented civilian masses who have gone from the autonomy of citizenship to military obedience for a time of unknown duration and who are plunged into a raging inferno where staying alive rather than being intelligent or courageous is the main objective and where even victory is a distant abstraction military service can rarely have seemed less noble than it did to the millions of men plucked from civilian life and trapped in the trenches war is the political state furthest removed from normal civilian life it is a purely instinctive business totally removed from other interests and intellectual pursuits an army at war is a social order in which individuals no longer exist and whose inhumanity creates a sort of inertia that is almost impossible to break
3080 from the first day of their coming into power having proclaimed the abolition of the death penalty the bolsheviks began to kill they killed prisoners captured in the battles of the civil war they killed enemies who surrendered on the condition that their lives would be spared these wholesale murders organized at the instigation of the bolsheviks were followed by murders at the direct behest of the bolshevik government having assassinated tens of thousands of men without trial the bolsheviks started their executions by verdicts of the courts they established a supreme revolutionary tribunal to convict enemies of the soviet regime the beast has licked hot human blood the man killing machine is brought into motion messrs medvedev bruno peterson veselovsky and karelin the judges of the supreme revolutionary tribunal have turned up their sleeves and set to work as butchers but blood breeds blood the reign of terror established by the bolsheviks since october 1917 has filled the air of russian fields with vapors of human blood we witness the growth of the bitterness of the civil war the growing bestiality of men engaged in it the great principles of true humanity that formed the basis of socialist teachings have sunk into oblivion
3081 you came to us to cultivate our ancestral barbarism long nurtured by the tsars and to place offerings on the antique russian altar to murder to elevate disdain for the life of others to a degree the like of which has never been seen you came to bring the rule of the executioners throughout the country the executioner is now again the chief figure in russia
3082 for me the richness of a country the power of a people is to be measured by the quantity and quality of its intellectual development revolution is a useful enterprise only if it favors such development scholars should be treated with care and respect but in trying to save our own skins we are decapitating the people destroying our own brain
3083 we would be wrong to equate the intellectual strength of the people with the strength of the bourgeois intelligentsia the intellectual strength of workers and peasants grows in the struggle to overturn the bourgeoisie and their acolytes those second rate intellectuals and lackeys of capitalism who think they are the brain of the nation they are not the brain of the nation theyre shit
3084 it is quite clear that if our problem is the abolition of private property in the means of production the only road to its solution lies through the concentration of state power in its entirety in the hands of the proletariat and the setting up for the transitional period of an extraordinary regime dictatorship is necessary because this is a case not of partial changes but of the very existence of the bourgeoisie no agreement is possible on this basis only force can be the deciding factor whoever aims at the end cannot reject the means
3085 in no case need we anticipate that in western europe the course of the great french revolution will be repeated if present day russia exhibits so much likeness to the france of 1793 this shows only how near it stands to the stage of middle class revolution
3086 if there is one true theory in history if there is a rationality at work in things then it is clear that its development should be entrusted to specialists in that theory and technicians of that particular rationale the absolute power of the party has a philosophical status its foundation is a function of the materialist conception of history if that concept is true power should be absolute and democracy is a concession to the human fallibility of the leaders or a pedagogical procedure that they alone can measure out in the correct dosages
3087 vladimir ilich affirmed yesterday that the proletariat as a class in the marxist sense does not exist in russia allow me to congratulate you for managing to exercise dictatorship on behalf of a class that does not actually exist
3088 the antagonism of the two socialist movements is the clashing of two fundamentally distinct methods that of democracy and that of dictatorship both movements have the same end in view to free the proletariat and with it humanity through socialism but the view taken by one is held by the other to be erroneous and likely to lead to destruction we place ourselves of course by asking for the fullest discussion firmly on the side of democracy dictatorship does not ask for the refutation of contrary views but the forcible suppression of their utterance thus the two methods of democracy and dictatorship are already irreconcilably opposed before the discussion has started the one demands the other forbids it
3089 a minority dictatorship always finds its most powerful support in an obedient army but the more it substitutes this for majority support the more it drives the opposition to seek a remedy by an appeal to the bayonet instead of an appeal to the vote that is denied them civil war becomes a method of adjusting political and social antagonisms where complete political and social apathy or dejection does not prevail the minority dictatorship is always threatened by armed attack or constant guerrilla warfare the dictatorship is then involved in civil war and lives in constant danger of being overthrown there is no greater obstacle to the building of a socialist society than internal war in a civil war each party fights for its existence and the vanquished are threatened with complete destruction the consciousness of this fact is why civil wars are so terrible
3090 in reality the state is nothing but a machine for the suppression of one class by another
3091 dictatorship is rule based directly on force and unrestricted by any laws the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat is rule won and maintained through the use of violence by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie rule that is unrestricted by any laws
3092 proletarian democracy of which soviet government is one of the forms has brought a development and expansion of democracy hitherto unprecedented in the world precisely for the vast majority of the population for the exploited and toiling people
3093 kautsky sees one of the reasons for the extremely bloody character of the revolution in the war and in its hardening influence on manners
3094 the development of bourgeois society itself out of which contemporary democracy grew in no way represents the process of gradual democratization that figured before the war in the dreams of the greatest socialist illusionist of democracy jean jaures and now in those of the most learned of pedants karl kautsky
3095 two forces the revolutionary proletariat under the leadership of the communists and counterrevolutionary democracy headed by generals and admirals
3096 it could and must be explained that in the civil war we destroyed white guards so that they would not destroy the workers consequently our problem is not the destruction of human life but its preservation the enemy must be made harmless and in wartime this means that he must be destroyed the problem of revolution as of war lies in breaking the will of the foe forcing him to capitulate and to accept the conditions of the conqueror the question about who will rule the country that is about the life or death of the bourgeoisie will be decided on either side not by reference to the paragraphs of the constitution but by the employment of all forms of violence
3097 during war all institutions and organs of the state and of public opinion become directly or indirectly weapons of war this is particularly true of the press no government waging a serious war will allow publications to exist on its territory that openly or indirectly support the enemy still more so in a civil war the nature of the latter is such that each of the struggling sides has in the rear of its armies considerable circles of the population who support the enemy in war where both success and failure are repaid by death hostile agents who penetrate into the rear are subject to execution this is inhumane but no one ever considered war or all the more civil war to be a school of humanity
3098 the overturning of the old world and its replacement by a new life in which the same old evils are kept in place a life that is contaminated by the same old principles means that socialism is forced to make a crucial choice during the decisive struggle about whether to use the old fashioned violence of the tsars and the bourgeoisie or to resort instead to revolutionary violence old fashioned violence is merely a protection against slavery while the new violence is the painful path toward emancipation that is what should be decisive in our choice we should take violence into our own hands to be sure that we bring about the end of violence for there is no other means of fighting against it such is the gaping moral wound of the revolution therein lies the central paradox the contradiction that will be the inevitable source of much conflict and suffering
3099 like terror violence considered both as a means of constraint and as deception will always contaminate the soul of the conquered first before affecting the victor and the rest of society
3100 i have not the slightest desire to return to russia i would not be able to write a thing if i had to spend the whole time returning to the theme of thou shalt not kill time and again
3101 it seems to me rolland that you would judge events inside the soviet union more evenhandedly if you admitted one simple fact that the soviet regime together with the avant garde of the workers is locked in a civil war which takes the form of a class war
3102 the basis of our activity should be simple ideals like truth honesty and trust among revolutionary brothers lying cheating mystification and of necessity violence should be employed only against the enemy whereas you my friend and this is where you are most gravely mistaken you have fallen under the spell of the systems of loyola and machiavelli you are enamored of police tactics and jesuitical methods and you are using such ideas to run your organization so you end up treating your own friends as though they were enemies
3103 i am so happy that they have been shot like dogs
3104 the enemy is the great justification for terror and the totalitarian state needs enemies to survive if it lacks them it invents them once they have been identified they are treated without mercy being an enemy is a hereditary stain that cannot be removed as has often been pointed out jews are persecuted not for what they have done but for what they are and communism is no different it demands the repression or in moments of crisis the elimination of the bourgeoisie as a class belonging to the class is enough there is no need actually to have done anything at all
3105 it was scientism and not humanism that helped establish the ideological bases of totalitarianism the relation between scientism and totalitarianism is not limited to the justification of acts through so called scientific necessity biological or historical one must already be a practitioner of scientism even if it is wild scientism to believe in the perfect transparency of society and thus in the possibility of transforming society by revolutionary means to conform with an ideal
3106 the violent revolution has become a necessity precisely because the imminent requirements of history are unable to find a road through the apparatus of parliamentary democracy
3107 the proletariat is the historically rising class the bourgeoisie by contrast today is a falling class it no longer plays an essential part in production and by its imperialist methods of appropriation is destroying the economic structure of the world and human culture generally nevertheless the historical tenacity of the bourgeoisie is colossal it holds to power and does not wish to abandon it it thereby threatens to drag after it into the abyss the whole of society we are forced to tear off this class and chop it away the red terror is a weapon used against a class that despite being doomed to destruction does not wish to perish
3108 against us is a whole outmoded society that has had its day and that should allow us to think of ourselves as still being in a civil war so quite naturally we can conclude that if the enemies do not surrender it is up to us to exterminate them
3109 the blue eyes of the revolution burn with cruel necessity
3110 to be exact however our goal is not socialism as such which is the abolition of every kind of exploitation and oppression be it directed against a class a party a sex or a race should it be proved to us that somehow the emancipation of the proletariat and of humanity could be achieved solely on the basis of private property we would discard socialism without in any way giving up our objective on the contrary this would be conducive to our objective
3111 the barbarian ritual of the purge and the idea of the extermination machine in top gear are closely linked in the discourse and practice of persecution to the animalization of the other to the reduction of real or imaginary enemies to a zoological state
3112 shoot these rabid dogs death to this gang who hide their ferocious teeth their eagle claws from the people down with that vulture trotsky from whose mouth a bloody venom drips putrefying the great ideals of marxism lets put these liars out of harms way these miserable pygmies who dance around rotting carcasses down with these abject animals lets put an end once and for all to these miserable hybrids of foxes and pigs these stinking corpses let their horrible squeals finally come to an end lets exterminate the mad dogs of capitalism who want to tear to pieces the flower of our new soviet nation lets push the bestial hatred they bear our leaders back down their own throats
3113 in my opinion the execution was entirely legitimate it is quite natural that a worker and peasant regime should stamp out its enemies like lice
3114 as always the poets and butchers of totalitarianism reveal themselves first of all by the vocabulary they use the liquidation of the muscovite executioners a close relative of the treatment carried out by the nazi assassins is a linguistic microcosm of an irreparable mental and cultural catastrophe that was in full view on the soviet stage the value of human life collapsed and thinking in categories enemies of the people traitors untrustworthy elements etc replaced ethical thought in the discourse and practice of the nazi exterminators the animalization of the other which could not be dissociated from the obsession with cleanliness and contagion was closely linked to the ideology of race it was conceived in the implacably hierarchical racial terms of subhumans and supermen but in moscow in 1937 the discourse about race and the totalitarian measures associated with it were quite different what mattered instead was the total animalization of the other so that a policy under which absolutely anything was possible could come into practice
3115 class hatred should be cultivated by an organic revulsion as far as the enemy is concerned enemies must be seen as inferior i believe quite profoundly that the enemy is our inferior and is a degenerate not only on the physical plane but also in the moral sense
3116 the time is nearing when science will imperiously address normal people and say would you like all diseases handicaps imperfections senility and premature death of the organism to be studied minutely and precisely such study cannot be carried out solely with experiments on dogs rabbits and guinea pigs experiments on human beings are indispensable for what must be studied are the human mechanisms of the functioning of the organism intracellular processes hematopoiesis neurochemistry and all the processes that go on inside the organism hundreds of human guinea pigs are required this will be a true service to humanity which will be far more important and useful than the extermination of tens of millions of healthy beings for the comfort of a miserable physically psychologically and morally degenerate class of predators and parasites
3117 legal texts about bioethics act as signposts about some of the more insidious threats linked to the progress of science whose role in the birth of ideologies linked to terror j ashers law of the movement has yet to be fully recognized the fundamentally eugenic thrust of work by well known doctors such as charles richet and alexis carrel clearly paved the way for nazi extermination and the wayward actions of nazi doctors
3118 as master of the knowledge of the evolution of social species lenin decided who should disappear by virtue of having been condemned to the dustbin of history
3119 classifications segregation exclusions and purely biological criteria that are brought in by this criminal ideology we are thinking of scientific ideas heredity hybridization racial purity and the fantastic millenarian or apocalyptic aspects that are clearly also the product of a particular historical moment
3120 recognize that the notion of humanity extends beyond the biological approach and that biology has little to say about the human person
3121 it is true that it is perfectly possible to consider the human species an animal species like any other a species that man is learning to make himself as he already makes other animal and vegetable species
3122 this sort of person behaves among other people as a surgeon does in the wards of a hospital his soul is really in his knife and the essence of these people lies in their fanatical faith in the surgeons knife the surgeons knife that is the great theoretician the archphilosopher of the twentieth century
3123 our people are not a blank sheet of paper on which any secret society can write whatever it wants like your communist program for instance
3124 do you remember how angry with me you became when i called you an abrek and described your beliefs as a sort of abreki catechism you said that all men should be made so and that the abandonment of the self and the renunciation of personal needs and desires all feelings attachments and links should be a normal state the everyday condition of all humanity out of that cruel renunciation and extreme fanaticism you now want to make a general principle applicable to the whole community you want crazy things impossible things the total negation of nature man and society
3125 the purpose is not to torture or to burn the victim the aim is to ask the right question no terror without truth which is its foundation without truth how can error be recognized if one is certain that one possesses the truth how can one leave ones neighbor in error
3126 the idea that the world we see is so totally corrupt that it is beyond improvement and that accordingly the world that will follow will bring plenitude perfection and ultimate liberation is one of the most monstrous aberrations of the human spirit of course this aberration is not an invention of our own time but we should recognize that religious thought which opposes all temporal values to the force of supernatural grace is much less abominable than doctrines that tell us we can assure our salvation by jumping from the edge of the abyss to the glorious heights of the heavens
3127 the memory of the terror weighed on peoples minds no one could believe that stalin had really gone for good there was scarcely a family in moscow that had not suffered in some way from persecution yet no one ever talked about it i for instance would never talk about my experiences in the camps in front of my friends and they never asked about it the fear was too deep rooted in everyones minds
3128 one of my old friends a worker from sormov a kind hearted man complained that it was hard to work for the cheka
3129 our century is the century of the greatest violence ever committed against human beings by the state but it is precisely here that the strength and hope of humanity lie it is the twentieth century that has at last shaken the hegelian concept of the historical process whereby everything real is rational it was this concept violently debated for decades that russian thinkers of the past century finally accepted but now at the height of the states triumph over individual freedom russian thinkers wearing padded camp jackets have dethroned and cast down the old hegelian law and proclaimed their new supreme guiding principle of world history everything inhuman is senseless and worthless amid the total triumph of inhumanity it has become self evident that everything effected by violence is senseless and worthless and that it has no future and will disappear without a trace
3130 i just wasnt seeing the production and when you get in a situation where you dont see the production and youve got a young group of receivers that are emerging i just felt like it was in our best interests to let him go at this point

3135 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
3136 it celebrates the excitement that he has generated that is certainly more akin to the excitement that a celebrity generates than a normal politician
3137 the mccain campaign has very clearly decided that the only way to win this election is to become very personal and very negative
3138 we believe that people will see that as nothing more than the same old politics and the same old policies of the last eight years

3145 you dont know where it comes from it seems like its something different everyday
3146 dylan is so brilliant to me he makes william shakespeare look like billy joel
3147 if you look through what has been written about bob dylan in the past thirty odd years you notice a desire for him to die off so that his younger self can assume its mythic place
3148 i love bob dylan i really do i love his early work i love the first time he plugged in electrically i love his christian albums i love his other albums
3149 it wouldnt be fair if i didnt name every dylan record it almost makes me furious sometimes how good his lyrics are you know you aspire to things im trying and trying to write a song and ill get something and ill say thats pretty good and then ill listen to blood on the tracks and think who the hell am i kidding what the hell am i talking about come in she said ill give you shelter from the storm asshole
3150 overall dylans probably my favorite of everyone the basement tapes are something i cant get enough of and all the unoffical unreleased basement tapes too desire is one of my favorite records of all time
3151 dylan is a complex mercurial human being of astounding gifts whose purposes are usually ambiguous frequently elusive and sometimes downright unguessable at the same time he is a sort of communicating vessel open to currents that run up and down the ages quite outside the confines of the popular culture of any given period

3187 getting access to edits from google users which are different and very complementary to the map share feedback we get from tomtom users makes our relationship with google even more interesting and strategic
3188 google chose to sign this agreement with tele atlas because they like our data and our innovative business practices
3189 we know that google still uses data from other map suppliers but we see great opportunity to continue to expand our relationship even further in the future

3191 s la verdad es que tenemos que cambiar un poco la imagen que dimos no pudimos conseguir el triunfo que todos quer amos que era lograr los primeros tres puntos pero ahora en casa tenemos que ser fuertes esperar que la gente nos apoye y nosotros mostrarnos para conseguir el resultado
3192 en lo personal buscaremos darle una mano al equipo para ganar y obviamente si es con goles mucho mejor aunque primero es el equipo y luego las individualidades
3193 lo importante ser el triunfo anote quien anote aunque uno como delantero siempre tiene la ambici n de marcar alg n gol
3194 puebla es un buen equipo tiene jugadores importantes que pueden hacer la diferencia as que hay que jugarle con todo presionarlos y tratar de hacer nuestro juego
3195 es un equipo aguerrido corren luchan y meten la pierna no te regalan nada y siempre tratan de aprovechar sus oportunidades nosotros estamos conscientes de que debemos proponer el partido y ojal tengamos contundencia en el arco rival
3196 ya estoy al 100 por ciento y esperando lo que decida el entrenador
3197 ya estoy al 100 por ciento y esperando lo que decida el entrenador yo estoy para jugar y ayudar al equipo
3198 tengo la esperanza ya de ir a la banca ya quiero jugar pas un momento dif cil pero ya estoy recuperado y quiero empezar a ayudar al equipo a empezar a ganar y a ayudar al grupo
3199 ste es un grupo y sabemos que quien juegue va a darlo todo hay mucho respeto entre nosotros y cada quien busca aprovechar la oportunidad y el que est mejor es el que m s ayudar al equipo
3200 me parece que no ser n iguales en lo absoluto me parece que los primeros minutos algunos goles de atlas fueron circunstanciales
3201 yo creo que jaguares tratar de hacer un buen juego en casa salir de esa situaci n de esa derrota dolorosa que tuvo y reitero no va ser presa f cil
3202 desde luego que s yo creo que es lo que menos pensamos en este momento creo que hay confianza en el grupo de hacer un buen partido pero no confiados en que ser f cil

3205 no va a ser nada parecido su cancha pesa mucho nosotros tenemos que hacer un gran juego plantearlo de la mejor manera estar concentrados no regalar nada ofensivamente son muy poderosos y hay que tener cuidado
3206 el perder puntos como local no era lo que ten amos planeado ahora tenemos que ir a monterrey a hacer un gran partido conseguir puntos y sumar desde ahora
3207 debemos aprovechar las que tengamos hacer un juego concentrado e inteligente
3208 es un gran jugador pero yo creo que somos un gran equipo tenemos jugadores con qu poder contrarrestar esas cosas y no es menospreciarlo pero nosotros vamos a ir a ganar est quien est
3209 mira l es un jugador muy peligroso cuando se da la vuelta es un jugador que pone muy buenos pases entonces en ese sentido lo que se necesita es no dejarlo dar vuelta y estar muy cerca de l nada m s con eso pone buenos pases y es muy inteligente para jugar
3210 s por ah cuando no le sale la jugada o cuando le metes un poco la patita se molesta entonces habr que meterle un poquito la patita
3211 todos sabemos que es un jugador muy temperamental en ese sentido ustedes lo dijeron cuando no le salen las cosas se desespera igual por si ven seguido cuando se le mete la pierna un poquito se enoja
3212 entonces habr que jugar con eso no se trata de ir a pegarle a alguien pero siempre uno como defensa siempre hay que emplearse a fondo tambi n en ese sentido
3213 te digo que va a ser dif cil porque est n en su casa pero nosotros tenemos que ir a ganar este torneo tenemos que ir a ganar a donde sea ir con la intenci n de ganar y empezar a revertir esa idea que se tiene de que es dif cil ganar fuera de aqu
3214 ramos es alguien que obtendr lo mejor de m he visto lo que hizo con otros muchachos habl con algunos antes de venir aqu pienso que puede desarrollar mi juego e impulsarme para que avance al siguiente nivel
3215 la verdad me siento muy contento motivado para seguir trabajando fuerte y obviamente nos encantar a seguir durante todo el proceso rumbo al mundial creo que de entrada independientemente de que es un t cnico nuevo y su primera convocatoria es un orgullo el vestir la camiseta de la selecci n claro que es una gran oportunidad para nosotros el estar cerca de l eriksson y obviamente de mostrar en cada entrenamiento que queremos jugar la eliminatoria
3216 me da mucho por l leandro augusto es uno de mis grandes amigos en el futbol y s que nunca busc naturalizarse para ser llamado a la selecci n sino que el se naturaliz por el cari o que le tiene a m xico tiene familia ac para m es un orgullo que un amigo como leandro sea convocado sobre todo que desde hace tiempo ha jugado a gran nivel
3217 los hondure os est n en proceso de jugar un 4 4 2 m s a la colombiana
3218 tengo 31 a os me titul de 19 en ese momento me dijeron que era el t cnico m s joven que se hab a titulado en m xico desde entonces empec a dirigir en futbol amateur y universidades hasta que llegu al veracruz de primera
3219 como pensaban que era muy joven para opinar invent un m todo estad stico de evaluar el rendimiento deportivo de los jugadores midiendo balones recuperados pases acertados etc tera que les gust mucho luego eduardo moses me present a paco ram rez que me invit a trabajar en cruz azul y a partir de ah conoc a sergio bueno lalo rergis nacho palou con quienes estuve en varios equipos
3220 para m el proceso de la selecci n empieza con lalo rergis a quien conoc en el s per atlante aquel de campos arangio hermosillo porque tiempo despu s tom la sub 20 y el trabajo en la mayor lleg porque paco ram rez se volvi auxiliar de ricardo la volpe y me ped an ir a ver a honduras guatemala etc tera hasta que en la fase final del proceso antes de ir al mundial ya me incorpor en forma con ellos
3221 a m me toc a hacer un seguimiento muy espec fico a ir n al que vi jugar en alemania en teher n en croacia y ah es donde conozco a memo cant despu s cuando vino el proceso de hugo s nchez salimos todos los que trabaj bamos con ricardo la volpe y ahora que est en reconstrucci n el cuerpo t cnico mexicano para eriksson es que me vuelven a invitar
3222 no para nada voy a mantenerme en contacto con jos luis y la franja como en la foto la traemos tatuada lo que s mi presencia en banca y cosas por el estilo voy a tener que dejarlas de hacer para dedicarme de lleno a esta oportunidad de hecho aunque me incorporo ma ana ya hace un mes fui a ver el puerto rico honduras entregu mi reporte que al parecer le gust a eriksson y supongo por eso ya me formalizaron la invitaci n
3223 yo con el puebla estoy vinculando desde que nacho palou era auxiliar de mario carrillo en 2003 yo le ayudaba a nacho y cuando l se qued como entrenador tambi n no en un puesto tan oficial como el de ahora pero con la franja ya son un mont n de a os
3224 entiendo que son procesos yo me titul hace doce a os siendo muy joven y he buscado hacer carrera en cuerpos t cnicos aprovechando los tiempos que no tuve de jugador profesional y entiendo que va a llegar el momento que se va a dar esa posibilidad pero por ahora no me corre mucha prisa de ya ser el encargado me gusta mucho lo que estoy haciendo como auxiliar aunque claro que tengo la intenci n
3225 pues a corto plazo no porque est uno metido en la competencia local pero como una expectativa claro que s de hecho sab a que un d a iba a volver a la selecci n pero no tan r pido y ahora aprovechar el trabajar con un t cnico de alt simo nivel
3226 ellos est n en ese proceso de cambiar de estilo a un 4 4 2 m s a la colombiana si nos acordamos honduras era un equipo que acostumbraba a tirar la pelota larga a sus delanteros que normalmente son r pidos y buscaban chocar para en velocidad superarte ahora son un equipo que juega diferente buscan salir jugando hasta que se encuentran los espacios
3227 con ellos est turcios aquel que jugara en tecos de le n que est en italia suazo en general tienen 7 u 8 jugadores jugando en europa por lo que no van a ser f ciles pero ya les detectamos algunas debilidades que obviamente no te las puedo comentar pero en su momento las sabr n
3228 la verdad que muy contento y sorprendido la verdad que no esperaba el llamado si bien uno siempre est trabajando con aspiraci n y el objetivo de alg n momento de estar en la selecci n hoy s me toma de sorpresa pero contento y motivado hay que esperar y seguir haciendo bien las cosas aqu en el club y reportarnos con muchas ganas y con mucha actitud sobre todo de aportar
3229 no lo esperaba aunque siempre me dedico al trabajo la aspiraci n es estar trabajando pesando en llegar un d a a la selecci n pasando primero por buenos resultados en tu club y ahorita la sorpresa ah est porque me acabo de enterar por medio de sus cuestionamientos lo que menos me esperaba era que me preguntaran eso y pues es una motivaci n extra en el trabajo individual
3230 totalmente de acuerdo es el trabajo y si nos conformamos simplemente con un llamado o con aparecer ahorita estamos muy equivocados vamos a mantenernos hay compa eros que lo han hecho muy bien hay muy buena base buena escuela con qui n respaldarnos y empaparnos muy r pido de lo que es el trabajo en la selecci n para que sea el primero de muchos llamados
3231 es trabajar entregarte no hay que relajarnos ni mucho menos ni echar las campanas al vuelo se puede ver con la filosof a de que no he logrado absolutamente nada el trabajo tiene que seguir reflej ndose tanto en toluca como en la selecci n y con cada entrenamiento
3232 estoy muy contento siempre es un honor y un privilegio entrar en los planes de la selecci n sobre todo ahora por ser tomado en cuenta desde un principio por el nuevo t cnico nacional portar la playera verde siempre me va a dar alegr a y esta vez no es la excepci n
3233 leandro es mexicano y mientras tanto puede vestir la playera de la selecci n si ayuda y defiende los colores de nuestro pa s es bienvenido a lo largo del tiempo que ha jugado con su equipo pumas ha demostrado de su gran capacidad y la gran calidad que tiene dentro de la cancha lo nico que puedo decir es que esperemos que aporte mucho en nuestra selecci n
3234 esas decisiones las toma el t cnico yo estoy para trabajar y cumplir con las rdenes del entrenador obviamente que mi deseo es jugar desde el primer compromiso por que para eso trabajo d a a d a con el equipo sin embargo hay que ir paso a paso y aprovechar este llamado para conocer al nuevo entrenador y posteriormente ser tomado en cuenta con frecuencia

3240 i know what mary will say now shell say dope users are sick and we should just understand
3241 we believed in slavery for 18 and a half centuries before we came to know gods will for us with respect to people of colour
3242 it has been more painful than i thought it might be
3243 ive felt the exclusion profoundly i understand thats just the way it has to be but its a very odd and difficult feeling to have been separated from your own house of bishops by an external force
3244 as a constant and steady reminder that every bishop in the anglican communion has gay and lesbian people in their diocese whether they know it or not whether they know who they are or not whether it homosexuality is legal or not
3245 i dont consider them enemies at all and its no surprise to me that people who live in contexts very different from our own in the united states see this problem very differently
3246 its no surprise that many of these bishops and people in these countries where homosexuality is publishable sometimes by imprisonment have not had the experience we have had in the american church which is of faithful lesbian and gay people in the pews making themselves known to us and our having to grapple with that issue
3247 that doesnt mean i dont believe we shouldnt be changing those attitudes
3248 resist the push by those who are not here to try and settle this once and for all because in the end i think we will come to regret our rejection of gay and lesbian people the way we have come to regret our support for slavery and our virtual rejection of women
3249 the beauty of anglicanism is that it has been a big umbrella under which we can disagree about many things so long as we agree on the essentials
3250 i would plead for a continuation of that great tradition in which we hold together and we continue to be the church despite our differences on this issue because i dont think it rises to the level of being an essential
3251 you dont hear anyone on the side of those who would argue for greater inclusion of gay and lesbian people argue that anyone else has to leave no one is saying that the conservatives within the communion should leave because they dont understand the will of god
3252 that is what you hear coming from the other side and the difficulty of course is that you cant make anyone stay i would make a plea for our holding together while we live in this tension for a while
3253 we have no parishes threatening to break away i might even say its the one diocese in the whole of the anglican communion that doesnt deal with this issue at all

3309 we are trying to cover our costs from last year we were unable to hire three new employees last year and we want to do that this year it is important we do that
3310 we are attempting to maintain a full staff and to maintain our transport van that has over 300 000 miles on it for transporting prisoners rather than using three patrol units and tying up three deputies and at the same time save fuel
3311 with fuel cost increases we know money is tight i have been very honest about what we need and not asked for unnecessary things just level funding for each area
3312 its the commissions choice financing is not my responsibility i have to have money to run the department but they are the ones under the law who have to make the decisions how it is dispersed
3313 what the decision boils down to is we can spend money on maintenance or we can buy some new patrol cars to replace our aging fleet and keep this process going so we dont get in a hole with high mileage cars
3314 i think it is important we maintain good new if possible equipment so we can respond to our communitys calls
3315 all our budgets will balance by the end of the fiscal year

3317 doesnt it give you a lot of confidence that im in charge of technical education

3326 not true and i have an attorney generals opinion to back it up
3327 i didnt want that to be an issue since im retiring
3328 could not vote on anything pertaining to the school system
3329 i think that may be what he actually thinks but i was very careful to get an opinion from the state on that
3330 i know thats not the only reason theyre running but thats a real poor reason to be running because there are many many many issues other than the schools
3331 i feel like its been an advantage with me knowing what i know about the schools especially with the construction and planning for the high school
3332 i have been able to provide insight into some things we might have missed had i not been in on those discussions
3333 i could vote on the bond issues and anything to do with the school tax i was free to discuss all that i just cant vote on school board members
3334 i have been wrestling with the decision for a couple of years
3335 my husbands been retired five years i just decided it was time i was told several years ago when it was your time youd know it
3336 ive enjoyed working with her shes an institution in the school system i regret it and hate losing her the older i get and closer i get to it i can certainly understand her decision i wish her the best
3337 weve been discussing what to do if she made that decision
3338 we dont have all those plans finalized but we do have a plan there will be some changes to the way that particular school is structured
3339 we might move on that sooner than we originally planned to
3340 well start looking to implement procedures on what to do to replace her shortly after school starts
3341 ive seen a lot of changes over the last 40 years good and bad
3342 everything revolved around the school now both parents have to work and theyre going in a hundred different directions i see it as a hardship for the families but theyve had to because of the economy
3343 we have parents working more than one job more single parents ive seen more grandparents and even great grandparents raising children and theyre doing a good job we help all we can because its been a long time since they had somebody in school
3344 i love seeing the children get out of their cars and seeing how excited they are to come to school and the trust the parents have in us they trust were going to take care of their child and were going to teach them everything they need to know
3345 my no 1 concern at this new school has been safety its been a real challenge

3354 with all its sham drudgery and broken dreams it is still a beautiful world
3355 i was very impressed with the work that folks from robinson amp waldrop landscape group and roberts landscape amp turf management did around our citys welcome signs
3356 it was nice to see someone willing to donate their time and give back to our city and i think the landscaping they did looks great
3357 id like to also thank our beautification board for their input on the designs i think the welcome signs are a great addition to the city
3358 at night theyre really pretty we just appreciate so much these guys doing that for the city
3359 its really nice when people take an interest and do these things because that wouldve cost us a lot of money by them doing this it allowed us to have resources for other projects
3360 we moved back here and started our business in albertville albertvilles been good to us and weve done a lot of work here we just wanted to give back to the city
3361 we feel horticultures a very important part of the city we felt like the signs needed to portray that look
3362 we just kind of came together as a team and built them to help out the city of albertville
3363 most of my life ive worked for civil service that really didnt afford me the opportunity to step out in the world of politics
3364 i looked at all of the candidates that had qualified at that time and made my choice based on what i knew about their political positions and mine
3365 i loved it and did not want to leave but it was just too costly
3366 it has proved to be a very good change for us no nights or weekends i have an actual life and can go visit my grandbabies in dothan
3367 its very good for employees just because its very convenient her prices are reasonable where people can afford to eat there a lot of people regularly come in from local businesses on this block
3368 neenas very personable and never in my years have they sat you down and waited on you i mean they actually wait on you
3369 for years there has been a back and forth on the issue of complete privatisation and internationalisation of the dns core resource management the topic nearly led to a failure of the
3370 that it is important to clarify that we are not in discussions with either party to change the respective roles of the department icann or verisign regarding the management of the authoritative root zone file nor do we have any plans to undertake such discussions

3381 the president has failed in his economic policy and now he wants to say but for drilling in protected areas offshore our economy would be thriving and the price of gas would be lower
3382 that hoax is unworthy of the serious debate we must have to relieve the pain of consumers at the pump and to promote energy independence

3394 we cannot say there is no benefit but we can no longer say there is a 20 to 30 lower risk of pneumonia it could more like 5 or 10

3402 she screwed us over with the basic budget then left
3403 i firmly believe that in the years ahead our military is much more likely to engage in asymmetric conflict than conventional conflict against a rising state power
3404 we must be ready for both kinds of conflict and fund the capabilities to do both
3405 there is no doubt in my mind that the modernization programs will continue to have strong institutional and congressional support i just want to make sure that the capabilities we need for the conflicts were in and most likely to face in the foreseeable future also are sustained long term
3406 i dont see either nation as a threat to the united states at this point
3407 but they both are investing in modernization programs that are of concern
3408 will respond to chinas expanding military power and to the uncertainties over how it might be used
3409 to revert to outright global military confrontation but the risk of miscalculation or conflict arising out of economic coercion has increased
3410 i checked in with theo a couple of days ago and we did talk about some things
3411 in the end they really just wanted to move him
3412 and epstein got jason bay a guy who was going to help him right away we couldnt give him a guy who was going to help him right away
3413 one pitch one mistake thats too much the ball didnt hit him
3414 i didnt do nothing yesterday one pitch one mistake i didnt try to hit him
3415 gonzalez is coming over here mainly because of the guzman injury and we need him to play shortstop
3416 that being said were going to try to see the younger guys
3417 when you are a free agent at the end of the year you always think about anything but it was a little surprising because i still believe that the tigers are still in the race at the time they were 5 1 2 games out of first in the american league central theyre just going through a different road and planning to catch brandon inge a little more
3418 he understands what it takes to be a yankee and hes excited about being a yankee and what lies before us and the challenges pudges caught in two world series was a champion in one
3419 he was anxious to get going he was anxious to be a part of this catchers got a lot to do you got to get new shin guards ready and fitted theres a lot of things that you got to do i was never traded in the middle of the season so i didnt have to deal with that
3420 he got here early went to lunch came back and wanted to watch a lot of film he talked to tony pena i think in a sense from a logistics standpoint the player that has to learn the most is a catcher because you got signs from the bench when youre on defense you got signs when youre on offense every pitcher has different signs so its a lot to go through
3421 molina is a doing a great job for the pitchers doing a great job defensively throwing and calling games
3422 to be honest it was a surprise its the last day of the trading deadline and a trade like this comes its still for me hard to believe that im here talking to you guys here in yankee stadium with a new york yankee uniform
3423 its going to be good for the yankees i think we have two good weapons for this team
3424 molina tony pena tells me that the pitchers are doing a good job of covering the runners were going to try our best to cut the running game out
3425 we want to cross that finish line and play a 163rd game this year hopefully every move we make will put us closer
3426 never before in an election cycle has so much attention turned to the youth vote and luke will bring a unique perspective to covering it
3427 im not trying to be my father hes irreplaceable im simply trying to do something that i think theres a real niche for that theres a calling for that has to do with youth not just in the election but in politics from now on
3428 our forecast is for high defaults and bankruptcies this year and next
3429 the big question is going to be whether the economy goes into recession
3430 in matters of prioritizing what needs to be done immediately always supercedes what is seemingly important
3431 its a fundamental law of nature all things gravitate toward total chaos

3465 y lo segundo tiene que ver con las reformas estructurales de la polic a por ejemplo estamos esperando que se integre un agrupamiento especial de la polic a con capacidad de tener intervenci n con j venes para qu ser a eso til por ejemplo en los partidos de f tbol esta agrupaci n una agrupaci n mixta se acercar a m s con un esp ritu de mediaci n de contenci n y resoluci n no violenta de conflictos y la fuerza p blica se quedar a atr s

3472 for nearly two years a young political aide sought to cultivate a farm system for republicans at the justice department hiring scores of prosecutors and immigration judges who espoused conservative priorities and christian lifestyle choices
3473 that aide monica m goodling exercised what amounted to veto power over a wide range of critical jobs asking candidates for their views ion and same sex marriage and maneuvering around senior officials who outranked her including the departments second in command the report concluded yesterday that goodling and others had broken civil service laws run afoul of department policy and engaged in misconduct a finding that could expose them to further scrutiny and sanctions

3475 the conservatism that speaks to us through its actions in washington is institutionally opposed to those baseline good intentions we learned about in elementary school its leaders laugh off the idea of the public interest as airy fairy nonsense they caution against bringing top notch talent into government service they declare war on public workers they have made a cult of outsourcing and privatizing they have wrecked established federal operations because they disagree with them and they have deliberately piled up an everest of debt in order to force the government into crisis the ruination they have wrought has been thorough it has been a professional job repairing it will require years of political action
3476 we are a free and sovereign people we govern ourselves and the government is ours but that is the point we are responsible not our leaders since we follow them we let them divert our loyalty from the united states to some party we let them boss the party and turn our municipal democracies into autocracies and our republican nation into a plutocracy we cheat our government and we let our leaders loot it and we let them wheedle and bribe our sovereignty from us

3500 that right there is as plain as it gets about the racism in verona
3501 you would think the borough would come and do something about it
3502 verona was a place that you could raise a family
3503 it wasnt city life where you have to worry about being robbed walking down the street
3504 if you cant keep up with the times then who do you blame for that the worlds not going to stop growing because youre stuck in a time zone
3505 they always felt that they were second class citizens to oakmont
3506 you cant get a place like this in penn hills
3507 now im looking at the black people in the street like who the hell is that
3508 im a lot more frightened we have a lot of single mothers a lot of black babies are being born
3509 a lot of people have been born and raised in this town a lot of people are not accepting of change
3510 when i got here just on the other side of penn hills i figured what could be so different i was just shocked sometimes in this town they go too far
3511 we stepped into the kitchen area and announced who we were and that is when mrs berry came into the kitchen area
3512 we informed her that we have good information that the suspect was inside her residence
3513 if there is a chase and they see someone go in the house they can be there without a search warrant
3514 there have been reports of several individuals from the homewood area who are trying to rent or purchase property in verona
3515 if you should notice either a green suburban with spinners on the tires or a black jeep cherokee at a residence for an extended amount of time 8 hours or more or see anyone fitting the description moving into a property please call the police department with the address
3516 came from the police what the police wanted to know is are these people in fact truly interested in renting properties if thats truly what theyre saying when they pull up is that just a fa ade for why they are truly there
3517 im not a supporter of the program because of the way its running
3518 its not a racial issue the founders of the program have made it a race issue
3519 i dont know where theyre bringing them from but they are not from verona
3520 this vision of buses coming and unloading these black kids
3521 did you call each one of those kids to verify that they were from verona how do you know they werent lying
3522 and there was chaos between the church and the playground across the street
3523 people like the fact that theres a building where kids can hang out

3650 if theyre having more children many of the siblings also have autism we have a number of somali families who have two children on the autism spectrum and sometimes more ive been working to get somebody to look at this and pay attention because it feels like this is too specific to somalis its got to be preventable

3712 as the economy emerges out of a benign credit cycle increases in debt provisions are inevitable but in asbs case any losses are expected to remain relatively low
3713 we have also recently entered into two long term debt issues in new zealand and supplemented these with two other long term issues in the international markets putting asb in a strong position to continue to support the quality lending that is required by our customers

3720 because property is a long term investment and the assets are not immediately realisable these types of provisions are common to these types of funds to ensure that the interests of investors are protected during periods of market volatility

3743 over the last 16 or 17 years our school district has been living on the increased valuation of property value on newly built homes our district has been growing but since weve had people come in from columbia and buy 10 acres our tax valuation is going up
3744 because of the increase in tax valuation we were able to receive more tax revenue from property taxes
3745 weve gotten to the point now where our growth has stagnated
3746 we need money we are operating at a deficit and spending money out of reserves the missouri department of elementary and secondary education has added new requirements for graduation and the only way to meet those requirements is by adding personnel

3756 the past is history the future is a mystery and today is a gift that is why they call it the present

3791 and the house republicans principled stance against this bill just three months before their own elections and even after the president pulled back his veto threat gives me many reasons for hope three fourths of the house gop voted against the bill last wednesday and three democrats even joined them to bring the nays to 152 it was the house gops finest hour on economic issues in a good long time extraordinary leadership and principled arguments against this bill were made by republican study committee chairman jeb hensarling house financial services committee ranking member spencer bachus and in the end house minority leader john boehner

3836 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
3837 using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues
3838 this is a race about big challenges a slumping economy a broken foreign policy and an energy crisis for everyone but the oil companies
3839 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign and those are the issues hell continue to talk about
3840 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face
3841 so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
3842 on a day when major news organizations across the country are taking sen

3844 my independence hasnt always made me friends in washington i was not elected ms congeniality in the united states senate
3845 my concern with sen obama is that on issues big and small what he says and what he does are often two different things
3846 i want to look you in the eye i will not raise your taxes nor support a tax increase i will not do it
3847 you havent heard a positive thing out of that campaign in a month all they do is try to run me down

3863 i just returned from berlin where i continued work on the design of only death is real the illustrated history of hellhammer and early celtic frost with the books layouter hendrik hellige if all goes according to plan the book will be in print in 2009 as a large format and very detailed biography covering the years 1981 to 1985 it also features artwork flyers memorabilia and hundreds of photos most of which have never been published before the material we have compiled during the past three and a half years is simply stunning even if one is only marginally interested in hellhammer and celtic frost the book will provide a truly unique glimpse at the early days of extreme metal
3864 cucifixus is but one of many compositions to that end triptykon is not defined by just this one song however just like celtic frost was not defined by totengott alone
3865 the irresolvable severe erosion of the personal basis so urgently required to collaborate within a band so unique volatile and ambitious

3922 hes a return man that has some track record and he has a background in other areas be it as a gunner or covering kicks
3923 hes shown hes capable of doing that and hes had a nice career doing that
3924 i honestly think im peaking right now as far as my career goes and i feel better than i do when i had my pro bowl year
3925 this is a good situation for me to be a part of
3926 i just went in and had them checked out and they told me you know you have a little astigmatism
3927 im happy because i never knew now i can be 20 20 and be back in action
3928 theyve lost a friend theyve lost a teammate theyve lost a brother and thats not easy
3929 i think for the most part they understand the direction were going in some probably even support the direction were going in but its tough
3930 you take a player who has performed the way jason bay has performed off the team and you bring in three young players while 1 2 3 4 5 years from now it should be self explanatory right now its a shock
3931 its tough for these guys and tough to adjust to
3932 we felt we had the right deal and moved on
3933 if thats the case ill look forward to that atmosphere
3934 i played well and hit a lot of good shots
3935 im putting well so im looking forward to having a good week
3936 i tried to play to the fat side of the fairway instead of just hitting down the middle and i came off it a little bit
3937 it was a bad double i would have loved to make a bogey but a double is always a bad way to finish
3938 i pulled a muscle in my stomach and that takes a long time to heal you really dont want to hit any balls out of the rough or anything
3939 i got that worked out and then i had a few issues with my shoulder but i think ive got it all cleared away now
3940 during my years here ive seen how they have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them
3941 there wasnt a whole lot of pleasure watching that game
3942 we had a lot of baserunners and we were doing things at the plate we havent done lately
3943 we didnt get the big hit one hit here or there and it could be a different ballgame
3944 but when you have two or three of them it just really helps you focus in a little bit more
3945 when we were at offseason workouts i was having a couple of problems just because of my repetition
3946 well i feel that im back to where i was with catching the punts
3947 obviously i love touching the ball you get a little bit more joy when you run back a punt or get a touchdown for the most part i get the same joy on third and 4 when my receiver cant catch the ball
3948 seeing his abilities well coach to what he gives us a chance to do wade was pointing out how very interesting it is when you have a guy that can change direction like that and move around
3949 hes done a great job and hes brought a lot of energy to this team
3950 i know a lot of guys from boston and i dont have any particular fondness for them
3951 i have a fondness for this guy because he wants to get in there and kick your butt hes vicious hes relentless he goes in there to stop guys hes not just fooling around looking to get a check hes going in there to beat the expletive out of you and finish the fight if i have a fondness for him thats why not because hes from boston
3952 the list is long and the line is long and there are a lot of guys out there quality guys who have earned shots
3953 guys have to take a number kenny took his number and got his shot and he came up a little short its time for other guys to get their chance you have to think of the sport and the fans dont want to see the same three four guys always fighting for the title
3954 nobody wanted a kenny florian sean sherk rematch right after that fight
3955 it makes sense to us to go out and fight all the best and beat all the best and then go ahead and fight for the title it doesnt seem right to take one guy out and then get that immediate title shot
3956 i consider roger at the top of the weight class
3957 hes just been tearing through competitors in my opinion this was the best fight that could be put together in this division and im in the ufc to fight the best
3958 he was awesome if i didnt know better i would have thought he had years of experience doing it the hardest part of that is not stepping all over each other and making your points quickly he was so well spoken and he made excellent points and had good timing hell do that again someday im sure
3959 roger is a great fighter and hes a worthy guy but i dont believe hes on the level of a kenny florian
3960 im not sure roger could go five rounds with someone like sean sherk kenny has fought bigger and badder guys and i think that will show on aug 9
3961 roger has a great story and he has his struggle and people can relate to that he was a little kid selling gum on the streets of mexico to help his family kenny comes from a great family from dover and people go come on how can this guy be a fighter but hes a true warrior
3962 the thing i like about kenny is that he knows the way of the samurai
3963 when the samurai fights hes not emotional its an emotionless thing he doesnt use things someone else did to motivate him hes calm and cool and collected when he fights thats kenny too i really believe in this fight that kenny florian is going to be the matador and roger will be the raging bull hes upset at life and with the cards hes been dealt but kenny knows who he is and where he is and what he needs to do to get better he doesnt get emotional about it and i think that gives him an edge when he goes out to do his job
3964 jamars decision to violate the terms of our personal agreement for his potential return to our basketball program has left me with no other recourse but to rescind that opportunity
3965 at this time jamar and his family need to focus their attention on the issues that have brought jamar to this point
3966 for the good of our program and players we need to move forward and prepare for the 2008 09 season
3967 we support his efforts if hes not just shifting cost to local government if he is truly going to cut the cost of government we are going to support him

3972 the attacker was standing up right over top of the guy with a large hunting knife a survival rambo knife holding the guy and continually stabbing him stabbing him stabbing him in the chest area
3973 he calmly walks up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
3974 there was no rage in him it was just like he was a robot or something
3975 believe me if we could do our jobs without having you relive this terrible experience we would
3976 i tried to get to lay down at 4 oclock this morning but was up 10 minutes later because every time i closed my eyes id see this man in the window with some guys head i had just smoked a cigarette with

3979 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
3980 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
3981 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
3982 we werent suggesting in any way hes using race as an issue
3983 is using the same old low road politics that voters are very unhappy about to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
3984 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
3985 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
3986 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
3987 so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton
3988 i respect and admire sen obama we just have stark differences
3989 as i told the senator he can do more in six years that any of his opponents can do in 20
3990 people of alaska have hired him to bring money back to this state
3991 he has done that over and over and over again whatever these charges are he deserves the respect and our admiration we should wait to see what actually happens before theres a call to do anything
3992 hes brought projects to the state hes put our people to work hes protected the labor agreements
3993 its hard to fathom or believe that a guy whos given his life to public service would jeopardize that for a viking stove and a good deal on a car and rebuilding his house
3994 think of all the thousands of families whose lives suddenly got better most folks in the lower 48 have no concept of that that seems like old news to them
3995 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs

4019 giving comprehensible and appropriate information about survival benefit is extremely difficult in addition the reluctance to inform patients of the limited survival gain of palliative chemotherapy may be motivated by a desire to protect patients from bad news
4020 however the reluctance to address these difficulties and sensitivities may be hampering patients ability to make informed decisions about their future treatment

4025 we are disappointed and frustrated with the broadcast by sbs
4026 the purpose of the broadcast was aimed at heightening enthusiasm toward the beijing olympics by showing south korean viewers the magnificence of the opening ceremony there was no other intention
4027 we will provide sufficient access to the internet for reporters
4028 ensure that the beijing 2008 olympic games take place in an atmosphere that honors the olympic traditions of freedom and openness
4029 the comments ive heard have been positive people say its a small price to pay when compared to owning a vehicle they say raise the rates but dont take away the service
4030 hmmm how can i mess stella up i know ill block her shots
4031 stealing cash stealing economic value is a crime its a crime in every system i know of taking property thats not yours thats a crime but when were dealing with virtual property that question might get a little more sophisticated how do we know whats somebodys and whats not somebody elses
4032 particularly if there is a set of algorithms or rules in the game that everything is free for the taking that might is right so we have to be very careful about terms like stealing because stealing might be clearly illegal clearly criminal and thats nothing new weve done that for millennia or it might be part of the gameplay at which point it is not illegal its encouraged as part of the overall interrelationships between the residents of the environment
4033 there is no one single approach taken by the providers of the virtual environments some virtual worlds such as second life were designed to include a minimum amount of governance residents of these worlds were expected to establish their community behavioral norms other virtual worlds include strong governance and control in these worlds such as the provider of the environment sets and enforces clear rules for behavior
4034 these are things that people can or cannot do to each other based on the way the virtual world operator has designed their environment violating these rules is simply impossible because the gameplay doesnt allow it to occur the code doesnt function that way
4035 who governs virtual world environments they are governed by criminal laws governed by torts governed by the virtual world providers rules and they are governed by social norms
4036 its a joint responsibility everyone provides a piece of the puzzle we have our criminal system that provides a piece of the puzzle our judicial system that enforces torts that provides a piece of the puzzle we have our virtual world provider and then the community itself does its own enforcement and that is a piece of the puzzle its a shared responsibility and it would be a mistake to focus on only one aspect
4037 congress has said for the most part they are not responsible for policing their own environments its totally up to them to decide how little or how much they want to do they might decide they want to make their world a police state and will regulate users interactions with each other very tightly 47 usc 230 says they can do that and they are not liable for the way they execute that philosophy
4038 similarly they can say were going to have a lawless environment and 47 usc 230 says if they want to do that they are still not responsible when people engage in bad behavior toward one another
4039 there are numerous gatekeepers in the virtual world safeguarding against numerous types of inappropriate behavior
4040 in second life for instance gatekeepers include our payment and credit card partners and our fraud and risk teams who guard against credit card fraud money laundering and phishing they also include our own governance team the g team which investigates abuse reports and guards against inappropriate content against teens on the adult grid etc and in many cases they include our own users who protect the space and land they inhabit
4041 as with any online community there are occasionally those who seek to disrupt others enjoyment but were able to effectively deal with any repeat disruptors by increasing the severity of the ban up to and including permanently terminating accounts
4042 virtual worlds that incorporate content that is inappropriate for minors generally require users to declare that they are old enough to participate most worlds that allow adult content provide clear warnings concerning the content
4043 avatars are not people they cannot be assaulted sexually or otherwise the one or two reports of sexual assault on avatars cannot be regarded as actual cases of assault any more than a description of an assault in a book or enacted in a play can be construed as being an actual assault

4077 my information from reporting today is that developer double fine brutallegend which owns the rights to its metal rock actioner starring jack black and thus doesnt have to just sit back and worry about what activision blizzard will do is very close to sealing a new deal to release the game
4078 to evaluate various options surrounding the release of the ghostbusters video game
4079 it wants the game to be released one way or another
4080 this has presented sony pictures consumer products with an opportunity to reevaluate the game release marketing strategy to potentially coincide with the 25th anniversary of the original film in 09

4083 the issue of homosexuality comes down to an issue about the bible
4084 underneath all the discussions and debates is how do we view the bible
4085 living under scripture the bishop and the bible in mission
4086 everyone in the anglican communion has their own process of making sense of the bible people who claim that their way of making sense is taking the bible more seriously than someone else are just trying to talk more loudly or stamp their foot more firmly
4087 is there such a thing as homosexuality in the ancient world did it exist then
4088 what you think is important in your context shapes the way you see scripture
4089 are understanding the bible in a very different way from that in which the rest of us think that it asks to be understood
4090 god uses language to tell us things and the bible is the language that hes used
4091 the bible is personal communication from the creator to us creatures and in personal communication you speak and write to be understood you dont communicate in code you dont say one thing in a way which is intended to be understood as meaning its opposite
4092 god is we believe straight forward the bible in that sense is straight forward and paul in 1st corinthians is straight forward
4093 whats the high common ground when we approach the bible

4110 vimos unas dos manadas a un kil metro en la secci n de estudio de la gran caldera dijo butynski hab a abundantes monos y no ten an miedo recuerdo haber pensado qu ingenuos eran pudimos realizar buenos acercamientos
4111 bueno dijo al fin evidentemente desconcertado tal vez los monos se fueron a otra parte de la selva para pasar la noche
4112 es una sorpresa dos driles coment deben haber estado durmiendo en los rboles cuando oyeron mi voz
4113 nadie ha estudiado la ecolog a y la conducta de estos animales en su estado natural afirm pero ahora se puede alguien podr a lograr que una manada de driles se acostumbrara a los humanos y empezar un estudio de largo plazo
4114 ciertamente ya no son ingenuos ni tan abundantes como en 1986 pero todav a hay una cantidad relativamente buena de ellos
4115 es una tasa mucho menor que la registrada en 1986
4116 la selva todav a est intacta incluso en lugares donde ahora no hay monos
4117 bioko no es como otras partes de frica oriental donde la gente ha talado los bosques de las cimas de las monta as para la agricultura sin embargo la gente de frica oriental rara vez caza monos
4118 s lo miren esas caobas en cualquier otra parte habr an sido talados hace mucho este lugar es demasiado remoto y dif cil para que tengan acceso a l grandes cantidades de cazadores es lo que mantiene a los monos relativamente a salvo
4119 sol amos pensar que los monos estaban a salvo aqu que los cazadores no viajar an a un lugar tan remoto
4120 saben que es una zona protegida pero la ley no se aplica as que entran sin problema y matan monos y ant lopes apunt
4121 los primates son portadores de epidemias y otras patolog as

4131 en vez de tener algo f sico que lo conecte a uno con el objeto que se est remolcando s lo se usa la fuerza de gravedad entre los dos
4132 si se golpea un asteroide con suficiente energ a como para romperlo pero no la necesaria para dispersarlo ampliamente se termina con una colecci n voladora de varios objetos

4256 lets put him on the federal minimum wage and get rid of the special interests paying for his hotel room across the street from the capitol and see how he likes it
4257 while i appreciate the governors leadership on this budget crisis i cannot support reducing the salaries of our state employees to minimum wage if our state workers had the power to pass a budget then it might be appropriate to hold them accountable but thats not where the responsibility lies according to our state constitution i cannot predict when a budget will be passed but i do know this when it does happen it will be because we worked to achieve bipartisan solutions i understand what the governor is trying to accomplish with this action but i must respectfully disagree and urge the governor to reconsider his executive order
4258 this is a historic step forward in the fight for equal rights for women its a shame that so many women still struggle to receive equal pay for equal work

4269 we had some really good talks with seattle id say they were pretty intense and pretty in depth we thought at one point there was a possibility to get something done there but it just didnt come to fruition we were ready to go forward both parties worked hard at the end of the day they probably werent as comfortable making the trade as we were that happens
4270 we talked to the doctor again today our worries arent that great i think what happened with scotty is if you know him at all hes not a go easy guy i think when hes working on something its an excess of swings excess of batting practice we just have to get him to back off a little bit and give his shoulder a chance to rest a little bit i talked to the doctor who performed his surgery again today and medically nobody has any concerns about him long term continuing to play he just needs a couple of days here and there in the course of the middle of the summer but were not worried at all like ive said before we made the trade we did all the background check we had to do on the surgery and we checked with all the rehab people we had our doctors check his shoulder is as strong as it can possibly be it just gets a little fatigued from overwork
4271 obviously the first thing we thought about is were not going to bring this kid up for one start and hurt his chances of playing on the olympic team and putting the olympic team in any kind of jeopardy we talked about that at length we said if this is going to be one start then we wouldnt bring the kid up but i also think that a lots being made out of this every kid dreams of playing in the big leagues i think if you went and asked all those canadian olympic kids last night when they were on the field if they wanted to switch uniforms with a big league guy right there as opposed to going to china i think youd have a consensus of saying theyd rather be a big league player i think thats an unfair shot at us saying that we did something that was against the canadian olympic team we have great respect for what they do and we have a great relationship with them but if we get a chance to bring a guy up to help our major legaue team unfortunately were not going to let that get in the way of us making the decision listen i was a part of the u s olympic selection committee twice so i know what gos into it but i also know that when a guy comes to the big leagues nothing gets in the way of that and thats really what the situation was with richmond

4449 voting is the cornerstone of australias democratic system and young people who become eligible to vote for the first time need to be able to have their say at the ballot box just like everyone else
4450 enrol to vote week aims to make young people aware of their voting responsibilities and rights and to remind young people of the importance and benefits of ensuring their name is registered on the electoral roll

4454 as the average climate warms up the heat extremes will become more extreme and well have more intense more frequent and longer lasting heat waves as we progress through the 21st century
4455 its sort of been the quiet killer for many years
4456 there were a number of days where the body count kept increasing and there was absolutely nothing you could do because the heat had already taken its toll it was a helpless feeling
4457 the safety of gerber and nestle nutrition products is our top priority
4458 i believe we should never have to make these kinds of choices ever again
4459 the big question is when will states hit the bottom we dont know
4460 i will not be able to pay my rent buy food or put gas in my car to transport my children
4461 the program is a head scratcher to think people are going to come forward and walk away from their life here it shows how desperate and delusional this administration has gotten in dealing with illegal immigration
4462 im going to go out on a limb here and say there wont be lines around the block for this program
4463 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
4464 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
4465 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
4466 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
4467 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
4468 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
4469 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4470 so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton
4471 i know that i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city
4472 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
4473 following a public exhibition period which ended in february the afp has been working on a revised design which will further improve the existing layout by moving the built structures away from penguin nesting areas and caring for the natural environment

4475 the redevelopment is subject to both nsw and commonwealth planning approval including environmental conservation regulations and the afp will adhere to these strict controls
4476 the aipm has been responsible for the upkeep of the heritage management for the collins beach site and fully understands and appreciates these important aspects
4477 there is no doubt the aipm is best positioned to continue the conservation of the site
4478 measurement of time weight distance quantity and speed are fundamental to our daily lives we frequently need to be able to estimate quantities scientists require both accuracy and precision when measuring extremely small quantities

4482 privacy awareness week is a good opportunity to review your privacy practices
4483 privacy awareness week is an opportune time to review your practices and procedures for handling personal information
4484 good privacy will not only ensure compliance with australian laws but will improve client trust in an organisation
4485 a high quality agreement that covers goods services and investment the commitments go beyond what each country has committed at the wto
4486 were not going for the guinness book of records in terms of ftas but as a small country of only 16 million people we rely on them for our prosperity
4487 of course we have agreements in latin america with mercosur and the andean trade pact countries but also with the european union the non eu countries such as norway and switzerland the usa and the major asian economies of china korea and japan we also have an agreement with new zealand and want one with australia too as we regard australia and new zealand our role models we are a middle income country but aspire to be more like australia and new zealand in terms of economic sophistication and living standards
4488 the fta with china got through our national congress in a day as did the agreement with japan you couldnt see that happening in washington
4489 in 1990 43 per cent of chileans lived below the poverty line now it has been reduced to 13 per cent and extreme poverty is less than 5 per cent having an open economy is an important part of chiles success efforts of poverty alleviation
4490 we have lots of complementarities between our two economies in mining wine and agribusiness and australia is chiles fifth largest source of foreign investment
4491 excited about the fta in terms of profile building and the stronger creation of stronger personal ties between sydney and santiago
4492 beyond tariffs into important practical areas that affect services and investment like standards and intellectual property
4493 being in adelaide close to the wine areas has made it easy for us and australias prosperity is there for all to see however the strength of the economy has affected our ability to hire skilled labour and we have had some productivity issues as a result
4494 business culture differences that means chilean companies should use pro chile and the chamber to help them navigate through these culture issues
4495 given chiles propensity to sign ftas with everyone else if australia has no deal well be left out
4496 theres so much opportunity in the resources sector in south america and chile has been at the forefront our ability to offer performance based products enables us to take advantage of the high volumes we can sell in south america the fta will provide easy access to the whole continent given chiles strong trade links with its neighbouring economies
4497 i see the fta as a building bloc not a trading bloc or a spaghetti bowl of agreements the agreement with australia will help support agreements with the rest of apec and in chile we hope this will add momentum to open trade more globally
4498 for indian companies australia is not only an attractive market in its own right but a springboard for doing business in the asia pacific region the fastest growing in the world
4499 in recent years india has been seen to increasingly engage in the asia pacific region and there is tremendous potential for australian and indian companies to work together in further developing this exciting market
4500 this growth clearly signals indias keen interest in australia as an investment destination
4501 what we are experiencing is interest in australia not only in its resources sector but from a range of indian companies as a location for providing significant value add especially in the advanced manufacturing and information and communications technology supply chain and in australias biotechnologies capabilities
4502 the increasing adoption of these new aircraft maintenance licensing and training standards is helping the australian maintenance industry become more competitive internationally and also opens up business opportunities for a range of organisations
4503 organisations like nsw tafe will see greater demand for their training as airlines move to introduce new technology aircraft and train their workforces to meet changing demands
4504 this achievement is the result of close cooperation between casa and the aviation industry
4505 i congratulate tafe nsw for grasping the opportunity casa has provided to take up these world class standards

4508 30 years ago indigenous peoples land rights were recognised in the northern territory the high court has now recognised their rights in the inter tidal zone and waterways adjoining their traditional lands
4509 this decision means that the traditional owners the yolngu people can have certainty about their common law rights and it gives them a stake in the development of a sustainable commercial fishing industry
4510 i am delighted that the traditional owners have indicated that they will continue to work with the northern territory government commercial and amateur fisherman to reach agreement on future access to the inter tidal zone
4511 this high court decision should be seen as a positive step and presents another opportunity for indigenous and non indigenous australians to work together to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome
4512 at a time of global economic uncertainty australias improving trade performance is a source of strength
4513 and on the back of this weeks disappointing result at the world trade organization this unambiguous trade surplus underlines australias solid fundamentals as a trading nation
4514 the australian government will of course continue to play its part in efforts to ensure we can get the multilateral trade talks back on track because trade helps create more and higher paying jobs and offers australians more choice of goods often at lower prices
4515 the mission will raise the profile of australias clean energy capabilities promote australian innovation and connect australian companies to key chinese energy sector representatives and local customers
4516 it is estimated this will require a 350 billion in investment to achieve these targets australia has the expertise to work with china and to become a world leader in zero and low emissions technologies
4517 china is already our largest trading partner with continuing economic growth a dramatic rate of urbanisation the challenges of climate change and rising energy demands china is actively seeking solutions to improve sustainable practices
4518 companies participating in the clean energy mission will include a world leader in wind energy development roaring 40s from tasmania which has fast become the leading international wind energy developer in china
4519 roaring 40s is an excellent example of how climate change represents not just an environmental and economic challenge but also an opportunity to expand trade and create jobs
4520 more than 3000 australian and chinese businesspeople are expected to attend events at business club australia business club australia will use the resources of austrades network of 15 offices in china to bring together australians and key chinese officials and businesspeople

4522 in both cases it was a blatant bid to evade payment of duty and gst in the case of the cigarettes the tax involved was in excess of 2 million while the tax on the tobacco would have been more than 1 3 million

4525 the cradle coast contains 66 per cent of tasmanias prime agricultural land protecting soil and water quality through improved farming practices such as controlled traffic farming soil mulching and improving dairy effluent management will bring about positive economic outcomes for farmers as well as delivering environmental benefits
4526 funding will also be invested in larger scale conservation where economic agricultural health and social impacts are considered alongside environmental impacts
4527 the wedge tailed eagle and the tasmanian devil are australian icons but a changing environment disease and urban growth are all putting pressure on these wonderful creatures
4528 the natural resource management body in northern tasmania will protect the nests of the wedge tailed eagle by limiting public access and establishing protective vegetation screens around the nests
4529 the funding will also be used to improve vegetation corridors across tasmania to provide easier movement and safer breeding grounds for the tasmanian devil and support communities to restore wetlands and re vegetate degraded areas
4530 the australian and british governments have agreed that individual military burial is the most fitting way to commemorate our brave soldiers and will ensure the heroism they showed in the terrible battle of fromelles will be remembered and revered
4531 should these remains have been discovered by post war battlefield clearance teams in 1919 the war dead would have been re interred with individual headstones our men are no less deserving of that honour and dignity today
4532 whilst acquisition of the land near pheasant wood for a permanent war cemetery is a commonwealth war graves commission responsibility we acknowledge the generous offer of land by the owner of the mass burial site madame demassiet and will consider the needs of all parties including the tenant farmer in this process

4541 if you want to take pressure off price we ought to be sending a signal that the united states is going to find oil right here in our own hemisphere
4542 theyre like a dog with a bone and theyre not letting go
4543 were not necessarily for drilling where they republicans want to drill
4544 the top five oil companies are now on track to hit 160 billion in profits for the year
4545 my republican colleagues are buying the line of big oil
4546 surely americans are tired of republicans delaying and rejecting every effort democrats make to solve our nations energy problems
4547 the american people are clamoring for legislation that will bring down the price of gas
4548 i suspect that we are coming to the end of this downtrend as applications for new mortgages the most important series have flattened out there is a good chance of coming out of this in good shape but average housing prices are likely to be down this year relative to 2005 i dont know but i think the worst of this may well be over
4549 i think were right on the brink id be more surprised if we didnt than if we did given the financial state
4550 i think the ultimate solution is a nationalization of both fannie and freddie and i hope a restructuring in that nationalization and then split them up into five or ten separate entities and sell them back into the market

4554 the danger exists in methods and tactics having absolutely nothing to do with picture taking
4555 in fact removing a camera from the equation is a very effective way of looking at this situation candidly
4556 recently the camera has come to serve as all but an official license to encroach on someones right to protect themselves from threats of danger it is also the most socially acceptable way to come within inches from someone who you do not know and who does not know you
4557 the extension of the conservatorship was at the request and suggestion of britneys doctors

4573 a estas alturas en am rica latina est fuera de orden un movimiento guerrillero y eso hay que dec rselo a las farc la guerra de guerrillas pas a la historia y las farc deben saber una cosa se han convertido en una excusa del imperio para amenazarnos a nosotros el d a que se haga la paz en colombia se le acaba la excusa al imperio les pido ayuda ya basta de tanta guerra lleg la hora de sentarse a hablar de paz
4574 me parece un d a no muy alegre en relaci n a las ltimas declaraciones del presidente ch vez
4575 decir que la lucha armada de las farc es un pretexto para el imperialismo es pura estupidez y tengo que decirlo y otra cosa m s ch vez no explica c mo las farc puede entregar los presos cuando tiene 500 guerrilleros pudri ndose torturados mal nutridos enfermos en los s tanos de las prisiones de uribe
4576 segunda pregunta es si ch vez entiende que la ltima vez que guerrilleros de las farc bajaron a la lucha electoral fueron masacrados y quiero preguntar si l est dispuesto a garantizar la vida de guerrilleros que tratan de entrar a la vida pol tica electoral frente a los paramilitares y militares que siguen en esta semana pasada matando sindicalistas no guerrilleros
4577 quiero preguntar si este an lisis y estas declaraciones realmente vienen del pensamiento de ch vez o est repitiendo la l nea cubana que hace muchos a os m s de una d cada est en contra de las farc
4578 mientras las farc tiene alg n peso en colombia una porci n de las tropas en colombia est orientadas hacia este conflicto mientras si no existe las farc es mucho mas f cil concentrar todos los esfuerzos contra venezuela

4584 dadas las circunstancias actuales en lo que a reservas se refiere s que es cierto que yacimientos que antes no eran rentables pueden comenzar a serlo ahora en este sentido si los estudios y perforaciones realizadas por la empresa estatal eniepsa en el a o 1978 frente a las costas del sur de galicia fueron tan optimistas como entonces se dijo la suerte estar a echada y quiz s nuevas prospecciones permitir an considerar la rentabilidad o no de posibles yacimientos

4613 initially she may not be aware that shes been kidnapped
4614 she may just think she is going on a trip with her dad and is excited about it
4615 as time continues reigh will begin to question what is going on and most likely want to speak with her mother
4616 she will have difficulty accepting that she cannot call and may ask her dad why it will be interesting to know how he will respond
4617 in this situation there were measures in place to protect this little girl that were broken
4618 he was only allowed supervised visits that makes me wonder what happened that he wasnt allowed to see his daughter for a period of time and why he had to see her under the watch of a social worker
4619 being taken from a parent is a very traumatic experience
4620 not only does this little girl have to manage the reality of divorce moving from her father but now she is taken from her mother as well without understanding why i would imagine that she is going to have some anxiety issues some traumatic recollections and possibly some depression as a result her levels of fear could really escalate

4640 quite a few guys had to play both ways it makes a difference i wish we could have had a full team were so talented youve have to play with who you have and do the best job you can
4641 i fully expect to get seven or eight guys back
4642 if we can get some of our defensive players back and we have the same intensity we had against willamette valley we had a good chance to win
4643 he actually started slow and gave a lot of pitches in the first but he got dialed in
4644 we didnt really change our strategy but i told them we couldnt be overconfident
4645 i mean these guys worked really hard to get here so we couldnt think that
4646 i just hoped to keep the ball in play and let the defense work the game
4647 my first home run in the all stars all i could think is yeah
4648 these guys played really well it was really tricky to keep them ready through that losers bracket
4649 we did nothing wrong the guys made some great plays then we got here and came up against some of the finest pitchers and finest hitters around were happy for mill creek theyre a monster team to face
4650 were here to win and have fun were not playing for a short trip
4651 when i came to seattle i thought id gone to heaven they gave me 12 000 they gave me a 2 000 raise
4652 i said gosh thats great thank you i just wanted an opportunity to continue playing the biggest obstacle i had going for myself at that point in time was the injury that i was trying to work through as it turned out that pretty much took me down that was the end of my career after i had that injury
4653 every time wed play new york id go for 12 or 15 points because when i got in the game the game was over with
4654 one of the guys i used to play against all the time was current lakers coach phil jackson the first time we went back in new york they were beating us by 25 or something in the middle of the fourth quarter i made a move and phil blocked the shot ok fine i start looking down the floor i look at willis reed and i say help willis turned around and told phil let him go whos going to get hurt nobodys going to get hurt it was the famous garbage time for a lot of guys who didnt get a lot of playing time when you got into the game you were going to put the ball up
4655 one of the most unique things about that team the first year was no matter what happened or what somebody was doing if i had a party if dorie murrey a forward who now sells real estate in mill creek had a party if star guard walt hazzard had a party everybody was invited
4656 there were no cliques there was none of this to me it was a really good experience because it gave me an opportunity to understand what a lot of things are about thats one of the things i have a very hard time with in todays world with the game of basketball its all about money back then you went to work and you had to produce you had to make things happen to me that was the most challenging part of it is you got to basically write your own future you know in todays world these kids come out theyre a lottery pick or theyre taken in the first round or something you got a lot of money coming your way
4657 its not a comfortable thing for me to do any more from the time the game starts to the finish youve watched a three ring circus if i go to a basketball game i go to watch basketball
4658 to be honest with you i was extremely excited when howard schultz bought the team because the first day he had a press conference and he made the comment that he was going to do what he could to build a winning franchise
4659 and being the ignorant country boy that i am i sat there and said you know hes got the money maybe hes got the heart and hes going to go out and do it and the only free agent he ever signed was danny fortson and danny fortson used him like a dang old watch
4660 at that point in time when clay bennett came along and offered him 120 or 150 million more than what the team was worth you know all that schultz cared about was the money
4661 the bennetts and all those other people they had money and they were willing to spend it and they did yeah they gave the city 45 million to settle the citys suit against them and the two remaining years on the key arena lease the city probably would have settled for 35 who knows all they wanted was money and thats what bennett threw out in front of them was money
4662 out of the whole situation where i feel cheated more than anything are my six grandkids
4663 my kids understood that i played for the sonics they never saw me play because they all came later but they understood that i was involved and stuff to try to explain this to the grandkids when theres not a sonic basketball team here grandpa used to do that that bothers me more than anything i just feel theyve cheated me out of part of my life but again its a business and those things happen in business people have to learn to accept it
4664 as years went on i regarded him as a role model and mentor if i was stuck he was someone i could lean on
4665 he was just a huge support and continued to be as i coached
4666 you cant miss the man on a wednesday and friday night
4667 hed have a story a day about playing in the nba
4668 these kids its a really hard to explain what each one of these kids have meant to me over the years
4669 the respect that theyve given me plus what i see them achieve in life is what totally blows me away
4670 people ask me why do you go watch shorecrest basketball this is the reason because theyre human beings
4671 im not giving them the tools to become a great basketball player i try to give them the great tools for life ive had kids call me from college when theyve gotten in trouble and my first question is why in the hell are you calling me you need to call your mom and dad they say dads going to mad dads going to be madder if you dont call him and tell him whats going on
4672 while it will hardly be the showdown it could have been the drama will still be palpable
4673 but im putting to bed the idea that well see a deal with microsoft anytime this year
4674 theyve lost about 140 executives over the last 6 to 8 months there has been a stream of executives exiting
4675 is it riskier to stay at yahoo or go to a start up
4676 then god got killed off and the laws just free floated in a conceptual vacuum but retained their theological properties
4677 dr paolo matthiae director of the italian archeological mission in syria discovered the greatest third millennium from 2500 b c archive ever unearthed it included more than 15 000 cuneiform tablets and fragments and unveiled a semitic empire that dominated the middle east more than four thousand years ago its hub was ebla where educated scribes filled their ancient libraries with written records of history people places and commerce
4678 i now realise that art for arts sake was actually a cry for help from oscar wilde and his friends against the reality which is art for moneys sake
4679 it may be a long time before we see prices as good as these again but it may just be that we are at the start of a boom which could last as long as the one in the 19th century mainly 32 years between 1863 and 1895
4680 photography i think as far as other media are concerned is still undervalued in general primarily because it can only be as old as the invention of the camera
4681 in the early 1990s records were being set at 10 000 to 15 000 now records are being set at 2 5m or 3m for a photograph
4682 our average loan size is 5m so we arent going to have thousands of clients
4683 we deal with everybody but we dont make loans below 250 000 simply because were just not geared to that level of business
4684 that being said we would have to have a minimum value of 500 000 of collateral that we were lending on
4685 that still leaves plenty of collectors out there but we dont tend to do the smaller entry level type works
4686 no collector buys in a void nothing happens in the way of collecting without information information is at the core of it
4687 you cant be a collector by just looking around and picking things
4688 the last thing you want to do is to get somebody to buy something through your own passion and your own directive that theyre not engaged with because the process ends at that moment because then it just becomes get me a damien hirst get me a warhol and that isnt collecting
4689 in 20 years time i believe that the most expensive prices surfacing on the art market will be coming out of china and russia and india probably for artists none of us has heard of in the west and possibly for pictures that have not yet been painted

4697 i told her i was labour when she cuddled up to me in downing street i said dont cuddle me im labour she said never mind come and let us have a cup of tea
4698 lauda was basically sitting in the middle of a fire and i would guess it would be about a minute before we managed to get the belts undone
4699 in the meantime ertl had got a fire extinguisher from somewhere and was aiming it towards the central cockpit area so he was able to keep the fire under some sort of control
4700 lauda was conscious most of the time and was saying get me out
4701 it is clearly important that i and the public should have a fuller picture of the facts
4702 today i have issued the order you have been waiting for the order to begin open battle against polands age old enemy the german invader
4703 after nearly five years of uninterrupted and heavy fighting underground today you will carry your arms in the open in order to free your country again and to render exemplary punishment to the german criminals for the terror and crimes committed on polish soil
4704 ive got to keep my eye on the road every second
4705 i think without doubt weve just witnessed the greatest day of scientific exploration that weve ever seen in the space programme possibly of all time
4706 misogyny wears many guises reveals itself in different forms which are dictated by class wealth education race religion and other factors but its chief characteristic is its pervasiveness
4707 hillary hated on you so that b amp is irrelevant
4708 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to
4709 this song is not only outrageously offensive to senator clinton reverend jackson senator mccain and president bush it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
4710 the sexist misogynist patriarchal ways of thinking and behaving that are glorified in gangsta rap are a reflection of the prevailing values in our society values created by white supremacist capitalist patriarchy
4711 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
4712 we didnt plan in advance how to move things around
4713 during my years here ive seen how they have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them
4714 tell you one thing and behind your back they do another thing
4715 tax rebates have been a very effective way of propping up the economy in the second quarter and less so in the third quarter
4716 to fix the economic growth problems you have to restore liquidity to the system
4717 i think in the short run its going to be a tug of war between the optimists and the pessimists
4718 i think both sides are going to be able to find enough information to support their case
4719 the challenge is you cant identify what the catalyst is that will change psychology
4720 what pat seriously why are you such a fringe psychonaut
4721 we have a responsibility to talk about whether these accusations are deserved pat i think when john mccain doesnt speak to pat buchanan as being presumptuous calls himself president mccain but barack obama speaks to you as presumptuous for doing something much less damning that says much more about you than it does the candidates
4722 his resume is very thin the american people dont know who he is if the msnbc shows say this night after night those less intelligent voters or those in a news hold will certainly come to believe it
4723 the crotchety old white women who were probably racists anyway and we dont need them
4724 hes the kind of guy you want to have a beer with
4725 it seems to me we are living in a time in which fear is used as a tool in the media entertainment culture and politics
4726 the media could do a much better job thats for sure especially the media that targets women human rights they couldnt care less their message to women is all about consumerism looking sexy and pleasing men in bed and yet they have the potential to make profound changes for the better in womens lives
4727 i have more freedom when i write fiction but my memoirs have had a much stronger impact on my readers somehow the message even if i am not even aware that there is one is conveyed better in this form
4728 we often hear about many hundred thousands killed in darfur and two million in cambodia all these big numbers memoirs bring it down to a family a face it breaks down that barrier of what is cambodia vietnam sierra leone darfur down to a father a mother a brother a sister how i missed my mother is that very different from how your children miss you how i long for my fathers touch on top of my head is not different from any other childs longing
4729 as a child it took courage to survive the war that i was in
4730 as a young girl it took courage to be true to my brown skin in a sea of white children it takes courage for all of us to be a woman a mother a sister to be together in a society that is breeding so much fear
4731 women have always been courageous they are always fearless when protecting their children and in the last century they have been fearless in the fight for their rights in times of conflict war poverty or religious fundamentalism women and children are the first and most numerous victims women need all their courage today
4732 we get so caught up in all these different issues whether its the economy the war oil crisis or the election that sometimes we forget about the challenges women face every day its important to come together and to re connect on that level
4733 sisters talk to each other be connected and informed form womens circles share your stories work together and take risks together we are invincible there is nothing to be afraid of
4734 our role as grandmothers is to protect young women and children to work for peace in every way and at every level and to improve the quality of life for everybody not just the privileged
4735 overall i think the more team members we have be it memoir writers journalists peace corps volunteers to go out there and report on human rights issues in the world the better
4736 ultimately i think our goal is the same to create a safer and better world for all of us
4737 i met him once and he was very kind to me i never got a chance to tell him what i thought that he was my hero
4738 i spent five years in a hospital after the war this is one of the secret awards i wanted i was hoping this would happen in my lifetime and it did
4739 they dropped down the age to enlist to 18 i signed my mothers name and she was not happy about that
4740 i never turned down anything and never argued with any producer or director
4741 i met him once and he was very kind to me i never got a chance to tell him what i thought that he was my hero
4742 i spent five years in a hospital after the war this is one of the secret awards i wanted i was hoping this would happen in my lifetime and it did

4745 the combination of sun and mysql means quicker access t
4746 this is the first time ive decided to leave something i really truly love i will dearly miss getting a chance to work with
4747 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
4748 and as i said a 22 billion surplus is the best way you can position this economy going forward it gives you a buffer for the future
4749 the bottom line is we have an impact on the global economy flowing through to australia from the credit crisis coming out of the us sub prime
4750 we have had the further shock to the economy coming off the back of the global oil shock the biggest that weve seen since the 1970s
4751 i met him once and he was very kind to me i never got a chance to tell him what i thought that he was my hero
4752 i spent five years in a hospital after the war this is one of the secret awards i wanted i was hoping this would happen in my lifetime and it did

4756 he held tight to his door handle as some beverly hills ladies lunching outside held onto the table
4757 when it was over this gal with a pair of fake boobies the size of the hollywood hills blurted oh my god
4758 no u s corporation ever made that much in a quarter
4759 but while big oil is making record profits you are paying record prices at the pump and our economy is leaving working people behind
4760 4 billion each year to the oil companies including 1 2 billion for exxon mobil alone
4761 pad oil company profits and save you at best half a tank of gas
4762 all those negative ads hes running wont do a thing to lower your gas prices or lift up the debate in this country
4763 so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton
4764 i do have to ask my opponent is that the best you can do is that what this election is really all about is that worthy of the
4765 has failed the american people on energy and that failure has led directly to our current crisis
4766 thats how america is going to free itself from our dependence on foreign oil not through short term gimmicks but through a real long term commitment to transform our energy sector
4767 im not interested in getting into a tit for tat thats not going to lower your gas prices
4768 the place of ones demonstration has communicative impact as part of the message that is being conveyed
4769 if there is no audience for this parade it is the equivalent of a tree falling in an empty forest
4770 so does the public get to choose as a first amendment right the setting for the pictures that they want to have taken do they get to format exactly how those pictures ought to look
4771 the court must decide if there is an adequate alternative and there are numerous streets and sidewalks within the secure perimeter that provide that proximity
4772 the constitution does not seem to say that this is about providing a photo op
4773 we have met or exceeded the constitutional requirements and their request for an injunction should be denied
4774 the only reason a dollar is a dollar is because its worth a hundred pennies

4776 we decided to develop an integrity survey that covers what malaysians think about themselves
4777 this is the health check that we should have had a long time ago so that we know where we are what we need to do to improve things
4778 the only real comparison we can make is when the following years results come out then we can see whether it is getting better or worse and we can then move from there
4779 we must not always compare ourselves with those who are below us
4780 what does it take to practice continuous improvement on a national scale
4781 im just trying to protect myself as much as i can
4782 i just wanted to get out here today just so i could get back in practice i dont really like sitting out and watching guys bust their behinds when i can be out there doing something
4783 am i happy with that no i want to be a starter
4784 ive always said i dont want to be a backup in the nfl thats not something im thrilled about but that is the role and i have to embrace it
4785 i would say it was a fiasco and i would say it was as clueless of a staff as ive ever heard we had guys in the nfl with 200 years of experience in the locker room some guys 10 years some guys 13 15 years talking to those guys it was a complete joke so that was a hard situation to be a quarterback who has never played in that situation certainly was difficult
4786 i think at one point i was 10 points higher than everybody and a handful less picks and obviously it didnt matter so thats disconcerting when youre in a situation when its open competition and it doesnt matter
4787 it was a year where at a couple of points he was hoping to be traded that didnt happen obviously he came back and had a good offseason its just been one thing after another he played a little bit then another guy comes in then we draft jamarcus then we sign daunte so hes had a lot of stuff to go through it has made him stronger
4788 hospitals heal thyself using lean methods to improve patient care
4789 telstra like a number of other major australian companies is affected by changes to superannuation laws made by the previous government we must of course comply with the law
4790 the take home pay of the majority of our employees is unaffected by this legislative change
4791 this is no surprise to our staff affected employees were informed of this before these changes occurred
4792 whether or not superannuation is deducted from any payment is based on the nature of the payment not on the employment arrangements
4793 the portrait photograph of the girl looking at the camera is obviously jess but although the photos appear to have similarities in style and setting im confident that the girl in the topless photograph is not her

4800 no me une ning n v nculo con antonio brack ni con la asociaci n de exportadores adex pero me irrita profundamente cuando un asesor del ministro de agricultura los acusa de ignorantes por el simple hecho de poner en cuesti n el ingreso de semillas transg nicas es curioso que brack que es uno de los ministros mejor calificados del actual r gimen sea maltratado de esa manera y ninguno de sus colegas en el gabinete reaccione en mi caso reacciono como un ciudadano que a pesar de estar en desacuerdo con su apuesta por un gobierno tan poco interesado en mejorar la gesti n del medio ambiente o por sus opiniones en relaci n al proyecto majaz considera que brack es una persona que ha aportado mucho al per y que en el caso de los transg nicos ha asumido la defensa del patrimonio nacional finalmente as le incomode a quien le incomode tiene todo el derecho como ciudadano y la obligaci n como ministro del ambiente de dar su opini n sobre este tema

4808 those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves and under a just god can not long retain it

4811 i leave you hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal
4812 my paramount object in this struggle is to save the union and is not either to save or to destroy slavery if i could save the union without freeing any slave i would do it and if i could save it by freeing all the slaves i would do it and if i could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone i would also do that what i do about slavery and the colored race i do because i believe it helps to save the union and what i forbear i forbear because i do not believe it would help to save the union i shall do less whenever i shall believe what i am doing hurts the cause and i shall do more whenever i shall believe doing more will help the cause
4813 common looking people are the best in the world that is the reason the lord makes so many of them
4814 i have been driven many times upon my knees by the overwhelming conviction that i had nowhere else to go my own wisdom and that of all about me seemed insufficient for that day
4815 labor is prior to and independent of capital capital is only the fruit of labor and could never have existed if labor had not first existed labor is the superior of capital and deserves much the higher consideration
4816 i cannot make it better known than it already is that i strongly favor colonization
4817 i claim not to have controlled events but confess plainly that events have controlled me
4818 in giving freedom to the slave we assure freedom to the free honorable alike in what we give and what we preserve we shall nobly save or meanly lose the last best hope of earth other means may succeed this could not fail the way is plain peaceful generous just a way which if followed the world will forever applaud and god must forever bless
4819 with malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right as god gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nations wounds to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations
4820 a house divided against itself cannot stand i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free i do not expect the union to be dissolved i do not expect the house to fall but i do expect it will cease to be divided it will become all one thing or all the other
4821 i would rather be defeated with this house divided against itself cannot stand in the speech and uphold and discuss it before the people than be victorious without it
4822 both parties deprecated war but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive and the other would accept war rather than let it perish and the war came
4823 i am rather inclined to silence and whether that be wise or not it is at least more unusual nowadays to find a man who can hold his tongue than to find one who cannot
4824 fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal
4825 public sentiment is everything with public sentiment nothing can fail without it nothing can succeed
4826 that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain that this nation shall have a new birth of freedom and that this government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth
4827 i have never studied the art of paying compliments to women but i must say that if all that has been said by orators and poets since the creation of the world in praise of women were applied to the women of america it would not do them justice for their conduct during this war i will close by saying god bless the women of america
4828 i have not permitted myself gentlemen to conclude that i am the best man in the country but i am reminded in this connection of a story of an old dutch farmer who remarked to a companion once that it was not best to swap horses while crossing streams
4829 whenever i hear any one arguing for slavery i feel a strong impulse to see it tried on him personally
4830 the probability that we may fall in the struggle ought not to deter us from the support of a cause we believe to be just it shall not deter me
4831 in regard to this great book i have but to say it is the best gift god has given to man all the good the savior gave to the world was communicated through this book

4834 the dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present the occasion is piled high with difficulty and we must rise with the occasion as our case is new so we must think anew and act anew we must disenthrall ourselves and then we shall save our country
4835 my friends no one not in my situation can appreciate my feeling of sadness at this parting to this place and the kindness of these people i owe everything here i have lived a quarter of a century and have passed from a young to an old man here my children have been born and one is buried i now leave not knowing when or whether ever i may return with a task before me greater than that which rested upon washington without the assistance of the divine being who ever attended him i cannot succeed with that assistance i cannot fail trusting in him who can go with me and remain with you and be everywhere for good let us confidently hope that all will yet be well to his care commending you as i hope in your prayers you will commend me i bid you an affectionate farewell
4836 discourage litigation persuade your neighbors to compromise whenever you can point out to them how the nominal winner is often a real loser in fees expenses and waste of time as a peacemaker the lawyer has a superior opportunity of being a good man there will still be business enough
4837 i will say then that i am not nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in anyway the social and political equality of the white and black races that i am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes nor of qualifying them to hold office nor to intermarry with white people and i will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which i believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality and inasmuch as they cannot so live while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior and i as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race i say upon this occasion i do not perceive that because the white man is to have the superior position the negro should be denied everything
4838 i have never said anything to the contrary but i hold that notwithstanding all this there is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the declaration of independence the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness

4841 the demon of intemperance ever seems to have delighted in sucking the blood of genius and of generosity
4842 the will of god prevails in great contests each party claims to act in accordance with the will of god both may be and one must be wrong god cannot be for and against the same thing at the same time in the present civil war it is quite possible that gods purpose is something different from the purpose of either party and yet the human instrumentalities working just as they do are of the best adaptation to effect his purpose
4843 we are not enemies but friends we must not be enemies though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection the mystic chords of memory stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land will yet swell the chorus of the union when again touched as surely they will be by the better angels of our nature
4844 what is conservatism is it not adherence to the old and tried against the new and untried
4845 we all declare for liberty but in using the same word we do not all mean the same thing with some the word liberty may mean for each man to do as he pleases with himself and the product of his labor while with others the same word may mean for some men to do as they please with other men and the product of other mens labor here are two not only different but incompatible things called by the same name liberty and it follows that each of the things is by the respective parties called by two different and incompatible names liberty and tyranny

4848 in your hands my dissatisfied fellow countrymen and not in mine is the momentous issue of civil war the government will not assail you you can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors you have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the government while i shall have the most solemn one to preserve protect and defend it

4853 i do therefore invite my fellow citizens in every part of the united states and also those who are at sea and those who are sojourning in foreign lands to set apart and observe the last thursday of november next as a day of thanksgiving and praise to our beneficent father who dwelleth in the heavens and i recommend to them that while offering up the ascriptions justly due to him for such singular deliverances and blessings they do also with humble penitence for our national perverseness and disobedience commend to his tender care all those who have become widows orphans mourners or sufferers in the lamentable civil strife in which we are unavoidably engaged and fervently implore the interposition of the almighty hand to heal the wounds of the nation and to restore it as soon as may be consistent with the divine purposes to the full enjoyment of peace harmony tranquillity and union
4854 i have been shown in the files of the war department a statement of the adjutant general of massachusetts that you are the mother of five sons who have died gloriously on the field of battle i feel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine which should attempt to beguile you from the grief of a loss so overwhelming but i cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation that may be found in the thanks of the republic they died to save i pray that our heavenly father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom
4855 it is said an eastern monarch once charged his wise men to invent him a sentence to be ever in view and which should be true and appropriate in all times and situations they presented him the words and this too shall pass away how much it expresses how chastening in the hour of pride how consoling in the depths of affliction
4856 if all do not join now to save the good old ship of the union this voyage nobody will have a chance to pilot her on another voyage
4857 neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration which it has already attained neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with or even before the conflict itself should cease each looked for an easier triumph and a result less fundamental and astounding both read the same bible and pray to the same god and each invokes his aid against the other it may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just gods assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other mens faces but let us judge not that we be not judged the prayers of both could not be answered that of neither has been answered fully the almighty has his own purposes
4858 all men are created equal except negroes and foreigners and catholics
4859 you think slavery is right and should be extended while we think slavery is wrong and ought to be restricted that i suppose is the rub it certainly is the only substantial difference between us
4860 stand with anybody that stands right stand with him while he is right and part with him when he goes wrong
4861 to state the question more directly are all the laws but one to go unexecuted and the government itself go to pieces lest that one be violated even in such a case would not the official oath be broken if the government should be overthrown when it was believed that disregarding the single law would tend to preserve it but it was not believed that this question was presented it was not believed that any law was violated the provision of the constitution that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it is equivalent to a provision is a provision that such privilege may be suspended when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety does require it it was decided that we have a case of rebellion and that the public safety does require the qualified suspension of the privilege of the writ which was authorized to be made

4868 i think we can all agree that the behavior of the paparazzi is out of control and needs to be reigned in before someone gets seriously injured or killed
4869 the safety zone is six feet i think its completely unenforceable
4870 unless every celebrity has a chaperone or a police officer with a six feet tape measure who are you going to enforce it
4871 i have felt violated i wouldnt call it threatened because i dont feel threatened
4872 its all part of the package and if you cant deal with it be a plumber but i have felt violated certainly many times
4873 theres more than sufficient laws on the books that deal with it
4874 give us a call well come in and deal with it but again i have no intention of supporting any additional rules regulations or laws we have enough in this city without piling more on in terms of for one time incidents sorry this thing doesnt rise to the need for that

4884 this was a particular nasty crime against a defenceless elderly citizen
4885 you dont even know i been drinking jager all day spent 200
4886 actually he said his dad owns the party bus thought he could grab that bus and go for a joy ride
4887 we leave the doors open so when the next group is ready to go they can get on and they dont have to sit down where its been so hot we just like to let them get on and sit down
4888 all of a sudden there goes the trolley up the street
4889 at the time that we went there 16 kids were playing outside of the day care in the playground so we definitely dont want any of those kids or anybody else getting hurt
4890 shock shock a good barber a good family man a good daddy a good friend
4891 its very disturbing to know that something like this took place next door to my practice
4892 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4893 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4894 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4895 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4896 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4897 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4898 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4899 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4900 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4901 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4902 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4903 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4904 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4905 even though twenty of them were from before 1963 long before you existed

4910 i find television to be very educating every time somebody turns on the set i go in the other room and read a book
4911 but especially at her impressionable age finding something else to read has to be preferable to exposing seventh graders to a simplistic cookie cutter depiction of religion and the religious
4912 i find television to be very educating every time somebody turns on the set i go in the other room and read a book
4913 dude lighten up try using an adjective once in a while
4914 they act like a pack of wolves stalking their prey
4915 the idea of trying to create a secure space around a celebrity whos a celebrity you me by some definition we all fit
4916 what is this protected space that they are entitled to that the rest of us are not entitled to
4917 this task force hopefully can look at 911 maybe we do need to create a separate number for paparazzi issues and for celebrities
4918 they know who you are you have an id number and we can help you then maybe we can charge separately maybe to the academy to the screen actors guild
4919 resources on duty that evening were all on duty personnel
4920 half of this issue actually about 90 percent of the issue is that celebrities should keep their clothes on
4921 paris hiltons out of town things are quiet lindsey lohans got a new girlfriend thats keeping things quiet and evidently britney has gone straight now in terms of cleaning her act up so basically paparazzi are losing interest
4922 the danger exists in methods and tactics having absolutely nothing to do with picture taking in fact removing a camera from the equation is a very effective way of looking at this situation candidly
4923 recently the camera has come to serve as all but an official license to encroach on someones rights to protect themselves from threats of danger it is also the most socially acceptable way to come within inches from someone who you do not know and who does not know you
4924 it is our view that significant laws and statutes are presently on the books to control overzealous paparazzi
4925 while the ppagla agrees with councilman dennis zine that paparazzi behavior can be considered reckless we do not see a need for further legislation that would prevent journalists from gathering the news
4926 they have no passion for media they have no passion for journalism or good news stories they just want to make that fast buck thats a big difference between a real journalist and a paparazzi
4927 what im here to do is listen im here to try and find a balanced answer theres no question that the industry of public information is an important one to protect and i think that theres responsibility on the side of entertainers as there is responsibly on the side of those seeking to take photographs
4928 what were saying is that we ought to allow it to expire and if democrats want to reinstitute the ban theyll do so at their own peril
4929 i think its an important issue and well have a lot more to say about it in september
4930 the last time they did this we won the issue in the publics mind
4931 he was not interested in what we had to say
4932 he gave us the impression that the last thing he wanted was for iraq to look anything like a success for the united states
4933 as far as he is concerned this is bushs war and must end in lack of success if not actual defeat
4934 when letterman is doing top ten lists about something it has officially entered the public consciousness
4935 and it usually stays there for a long long time
4936 i was puzzled by this notion that somehow what we were doing was in any way different from what sen mccain or a lot of presidential candidates have done in the past
4937 now i admit we did it really well but that shouldnt be a strike against me
4938 now i admit we did it really well but that shouldnt be a strike against me
4939 i personally would want to see our tragic history or the tragic elements of our history acknowledged
4940 i consistently believe that when it comes to whether its native americans or african american issues or reparations the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just offer words
4941 if senator mccain wants a debate about taxes in this campaign thats a debate im happy to have
4942 but say it doesnt were still under a lot of pressure to get a park that is our own that isnt going to go away so my hope is that well find a way to make it happen it has not been as easy as i thought it would be
4943 to lew i think it seems like theyre delaying things
4944 in lews mind i think he thinks theyre not being entirely reasonable im not super worried but im concerned i think its important that we get the issues resolved so that we can move forward
4945 but the problem is we cant give them exactly what they want
4946 wir haben um die akte vom amt f r landwirtschaft gebeten um die ganze information zu kennen im moment wird die subvention nicht ausgef hrt werden solange die ganze angelegenheit nicht aufhellt
4947 es gibt etwa 200 alle in einem verlies keine geschlechtertrennung auch bei den hunden nicht
4948 altering ones genetic makeup to impact athletic performance is unacceptable gene doping is cheating and its dangerous professional sports organizations should ban it all athletes deserve to compete on an even playing field gene doping undermines that right
4949 friends of the earth opposes all genetic modification of life including human life it is important to protect the gene pool our most basic common natural good from genetic pollution caused by genetic engineering it is impossible for humans to comprehend the implications of manipulating the genetic makeup of nature
4950 sport discriminates against the genetically unfit sport is the province of the genetic elite or freak by allowing everyone to take performance enhancing drugs we level the playing field we remove the effects of genetic inequality far from being unfair allowing performance enhancement promotes equality
4951 t his double bind structure pervades girards explanatory system both in reference to individual cognition and to sociohistorical development in girards hypotheses the same principle accounts for the positive as well as the negative traits of a given phenomenon imitation breeds conflictual results but is also the basis of any cultural transmissions its how we learn the other may act as a pedagogical model but she or he may also become a rival in girards anthropological recount the sacred is what controls collective violence but is itself also based on a pharmacological use of violence this is indeed one of the intellectual challenges of mimetic theory it forces us to think not in a dialectical sense as in a system of clear cut oppositions but by antinomies that is by concilliating polarized elements of phenomena which inevitably appear paradoxical because they are generated by a single yet ambivalent basic cognitive mechanism imitation
4952 in spite of having been deconstructed by a century of critical and philosophical discussions structuralism post structuralism hermeneutics this belief in the autonomy of the self mainly derived from the idealistic romantic tradition remains still deeply grounded in our understanding of the modern mind we always tend to represent ourselves as autonomous in respect to our choices desires and convictions moreover there is always a blind spot in our perception of reciprocal hostility competition and rivalry we are ready to deconstruct anything except the idea that we are self directed and that the persecutors are always the others
4953 christianity is essentially the cultural and moral acknowledgement of the sacrificial origins of our culture and our society the end of religion and even scientific atheism itself has been produced by a religion christianity
4954 i f the sacrificial structure cannot work any longer because its injustice and arbitrary nature have been unmasked then from an evolutionary viewpoint modern society is facing a new experimental phase while history becomes a laboratory in which humanity tries to find new processes and structures of equilibrium and stability
4955 the expansion of the christian paradigm which has imposed the rejection of the sacred and triggered the secularization of the world in fact signifies a phase in which man is no longer protected by the false transcendence of the sacred by the rigid processes of the systemic use of violence either actual or symbolic the gradual erosion of every dharma of every rigid social hierarchy and division based on sacred norms has plunged the modern individual into mimetic social flux deep into ever more extreme oscillations of desire and resentment mobilized by the increasing democratization of societies because im guessing democratization makes us all more or less equals erasing differences what has been needed therefore are structures of containment based on forms of secularized transcendence democratic ideology and institutions technology mass media market society the objectification of individual relationships etc which contribute to the postponement the holding back of the apocalyptic event the real ambivalent potential terminus of the dissolving of the religious sacred order of the world either the revelation of violence or the dissolution through violence
4956 i think that on the one hand it is true that i tend not to belong to specific environments or fields but on the other hand i cannot be considered an outsider in the classical sense of the term i never felt an outcast as many intellectuals like to represent themselves this is probably because i had and still have a very strong sense of belonging to my childhood i had a very happy childhood and i have always tried to surround myself with the things of my childhood
4957 the capacity to be surprised is legitimately regarded as the main scientific emotion there is a form of humility as well in the sense that it is a methodological attitude a postulate that you have to have in order to solve specific problems i have the impression sometimes that the book i am reading could upset my entire existence
4958 preferential sign of victimization the scapegoat will be chosen anyway at that crucial moment something will often be interpreted as a sign anything and everybody thinks they have found the solution the culprit in a way the scapegoat mechanism functions like a false science like a great discovery that is made or something that is suddenly revealed and then one reads in the eyes of other people the same insight
4959 if anyone kills cain he will suffer vengeance seven times over
4960 that law my emphasis represents the foundation of culture because capital punishment is already ritual murder
4961 one must never exclude the possibility of violence that has nothing to do with mimetic desire but simply with scarcity
4962 but it is also true that the conflicts once triggered easily become trapped in a mimetic mechanism
4963 the united states and israel share deep concern about irans nuclear program and the two delegations discussed steps to strengthen diplomatic efforts and financial measures to prevent iran from developing a nuclear weapons capability
4964 we also reaffirmed our strong mutual determination to counter irans support for terrorism
4965 irans ambassador to syria referring to sarkozys request from asad syria can clarify the truth of iranian nuclear
4966 we definitely want to position brand as the premier authority when it comes to steak houses

4992 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
4993 we didnt plan in advance how to move things around
4994 during my years here ive seen how they have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them
4995 tell you one thing and behind your back they do another thing
4996 there had been no warnings prior to that point in the game
4997 but my thinking with the ejection is when alex came to bat the prior time he had hit a home run and the very first pitch his next at bat was up towards the head area i deemed that pitch intentional and i removed cabrera from the game

5250 este programa es como emergencia ante la falta de inversi n de los ltimos diez a os en bolivia
5251 passing a resolution like that puts a lot of burden upon obamas candidacy and injects something that should not be injected
5252 drop the idea of a big march on sunday august 24th
5253 while there is plenty to be critical about in terms of the democratic party leadership we would not want people to see this as an anti democratic party protest
5254 the american people voted to restore integrity and honesty in washington d c
5255 if you fall into the orientation of trying to make the democrats be what they are not and never will be you will end up becoming more like what the democrats actually are
5256 agreed that obama is part of the system and i agree we need revolution but unless that is around the corner we have to be realistic and support obama
5257 i am extremely sorry i did it but i think the reaction is completely overstated
5258 during the olympic games we will provide sufficient access to the internet for reporters
5259 email and browser based in the cloud applications play a major part in day to day business transactions so a security breach of this kind could have catastrophic business and personal implications
5260 identity theft and business espionage are immediate threats and stolen competitive information could be sold to the highest bidder
5261 personally and professionally but hes earned the right to pursue whatever opportunities he thinks will make him happy
5262 im disappointed hes going for me personally for us professionally
5263 but when there were rumors about him going to toronto a year ago i said this entire organization is indebted to scotty for what he did from 1994 to 2002 and we have to support him in whatever decision he wants to make
5264 id like to think professionally we offered him everything that he wanted but i know he has his son involved in the chicago blackhawks if you ever get a chance to work with your family thats special
5265 he took us from being a talented team to being a championship team he got slava fetisov and igor larionov to come here and he put the russian five sergei fedorov larionov slava kozlov fetisov and vladimir konstantinov together hes the one who transformed steve yzerman from a great offensive player to a great two way player
5266 even when we made a good decision one we felt really good about it was nice to have that experienced voice say yeah i like that move
5267 i think his experience is the thing were going to miss the most id like to think that scotty was happy here in his role as a consultant i know i liked having him here we did a lot of winning and we had a lot of fun when he stepped down as coach he was a lot more relaxed and he was just a joy to be around
5268 this decision was precipitated by an unexpected and in our opinion unwarranted and unjustified act by our syndicate of banks which deprived us of the cash we needed to sustain and to continue those operations
5269 to ensure that all escrows are safe and all closings through the arizona texas and california offices will take place
5270 we have a lot of closings that are supposed to occur
5271 if people miss closing dates they can lose their loans the ones today could be in jeopardy
5272 essentially admitted to his conduct which was outrageous and clearly life threatening
5273 i believe that this is the appropriate outcome to a horrific case
5274 likely confined for life in a state mental health facility
5275 i think that theyre happy that hes going to get help rather than prison
5276 and we hope that alameda county treats him fairly as well

5279 e posibil sa fi fost intimplator e foarte obisnuit sa alegi o specializare la moda aceasta preferinta a candidatilor pentru specializarea relatii internationale si studii europene dar si pentru stiinte ale comunicarii se inregistreaza insa la nivel national
5280 este vorba de dorinta candidatilor de a obtine un loc de munca in domenii foarte atractive
5281 ne propunem sa invitam chiar elevii la diverse simpozionae conferinte sau sa colaboram impreuna pentru anumite proiecte
5282 desi se promoveaza ideea de inflatie de juristi nu cred ca este adevarat societatea are nevoie de juristi bine pregatiti pe toate palierele activitatii sociale la nivel juridic public sau privat explicatiile pentru care studentii se indreapta spre drept pot tine de mobilitatea profesiei in ocuparea diferitelor functii dar si pentru ca juristii bine pregatiti sunt si bine recompensati
5283 avem citiva ani la rind de cind nu ocupam toate locurile aceasta pentru ca noi avem specializari care cer foarte multa pregatire si pentru ca cei mai buni absolventi de liceu cu rezultate foarte bune la fizica nu ramin in tara trebuie gindit un pic asupra alocarii locurilor la buget pe domenii la noi nu prea sint absolventi cu diploma fara servici
5284 la noi este o practica biologica foarte tentanta pe teren pe care absolventii facultatii o promoveaza la rindul lor iar apoi exista o gama mai larga de locuri de munca comparativ cu matematica sau fizica
5285 poate ca unii nu se simt pregatiti sa faca fata unui concurs unde nu se poate trisa iar pe de alta parte desi sint pregatiti nu vin aici tocmai pentru ca se da examen de admitere sint candidati care dupa examenul de bacalaureat se simt foarte obositi si prefera varianta mai simpla a concursului de dosare
5286 din pacate modul in care se realizeaza finantarea invatamintului ne impinge catre aceasta varianta desi exista o cerere mult prea mare pe piata pe care nu o putem acoperi
5287 in acest an a crescut concurenta la facultatea de constructii si instalatii ca urmare a cresterii ritmului constructiilor la nivel national dar si la hidrotehnica geodezie si protectia mediului datorita celor doua directii foarte cautate geodezia si protectia mediului a crescut in acest an si concurenta la facultatea de inginerie chimica si protectia mediului datorita noii specializari inginerie alimentara
5288 la facultatea de textile numarul celor care vin sa se inscrie este in scadere ca urmare a falimentarii celor mai multe intreprinderi de profil din zona
5289 ca valoare globala a mediilor pe universitate aceasta a crescut s a ridicat nivelul ultimelor medii pe locurile fara taxa tendinta din punct de vedere cantitativ se mentine aproximativ la fel ca si in anii trecuti dar calitativ este in crestere
5290 la farmacie se mentine in continuare aceeasi cocurenta pentru ca absolventii si gasesc imediat dupa terminarea studiilor un loc de munca la fel si la medicina dentara
5291 in continuare este concurenta mare la marketing si drept desi piata nu mai poate absorbi noi trebuie sa pastram locurile la presiunea pe care o avem
5292 12 cetateni ai uniunii europene de exemplu au dat chiar si examen de admitere pentru locurile fara taxa
5293 piata muncii pentru prelucrarea produselor agricole este foarte dezvoltata in romania dar este si un domeniu relativ nou doar citeva centre universitare pregatesc aceasta specializare poate trebuia sa avem chiar mai multi candidati avind in vedere ca oferim specializari de care romania nu se poate lipsi si comparativ cu nevoia de specialisti in domeniul agricol
5294 din spusele cadrelor didactice s a realizat un progres in pregatirea elevilor care vin la noi dar ne am fi asteptat la o pregatire mai solida a cunostintelor in rindul stiintelor la chimie sau la biologie
5295 am constatat ca de obicei cele mai multe cereri de concedii fara plata se depun in perioada august septembrie a fiecarui an
5296 in cazul concediului fara plata pentru studii cadrele didactice pot beneficia de cel mult 3 ani in limita a 7 ani de vechime iar in cazul contractelor de munca in strainatate profesorilor li se rezerva catedra pentru 3 ani conform protocoalelor incheiate de ministerul educatiei

5304 esta la ped por tel fono me gast 18 minutos para que me respondiera un funcionario que lo nico que hizo fue remitirme a otro n mero en el que me atender an

5306 para que lo atendieran tuvo que firmar un pagar por 1 8 millones de pesos poco m s de 1 000 d lares luego ten a que seguir unas terapias pero al no poder solucionar el problema que pertenec a realmente a la eps se qued con la deuda sin la asistencia y menos movilidad en sus manos

5312 i think i was the first guy off the golf course that day at washington
5313 i guess they wanted to get some negative tests in before anything happens i guess they figured im one of the least likely to be on something you have to go to the gym to be on steroids
5314 why why bother you want me to go even more crazy
5315 i hit the ball about as solid as ive hit it in a really long time
5316 if i hit the next couple of weeks like i hit it today thats not going to be a problem
5317 they want skill to play a factor in every single shot and if you have rough like you have out here today it takes a lot of skill to maneuver a ball on the green when youve got trees in front of you but you can do it if you hit a really good shot i think the players really like what they see here
5318 this year firestone is one of my favorite golf courses that we have on tour
5319 last year not so much but this year all the guys are talking about how much they love it because we can play it we can hit shots we can be creative and challenge ourselves with some recoveries like on 18 that wouldnt have been a possibility last year
5320 these are the times that try mens souls the summer soldier and sunshine patriot will in this crisis shrink from the service of his country but he that stands it now deserves the love and thank of man and woman

5327 since de regulating trading hours and internationalising product supply the retail market has changed and now consumers drive the market
5328 a modern retail award must reflect the modern retail market which requires flexibility and the current award is structured around fixed trading conditions
5329 the aras recommendations recognise full time employees supporting the continuation of penalty rates within the context of a seven day 24 hour trade period
5330 the previous award was focused on the regulated market of monday to friday working weeks the aras submission also draws upon employee benefit schemes from other sectors to be incorporated in a modern retail award such as salary sacrificing for superannuation and other modern day needs
5331 consumers drive labour rates within retailing and it is imperative retailers have the flexibility required to meet modern consumer demand however the ara does not support rogue retailers who dont respect their staff or their compliance requirements and our submission maintains adequate protection for employees within the modern retail award

5348 gilles peterson does it again and blows our mind with an array of future sounding grooves as with the previous titles on petersons brownswood label the music here often defies style or label completely inventive work that points the way to a new generation of expression in modern music pulled up from the roots of older jazz soul dub and hip hop and fused into new modes new sounds that are completely sublime
5349 his guitar playing is just effortless and his words so insightful
5350 hes timeless hes probably twenty five but he seems like hes twenty five in 1972
5351 it is a rare combination when an artist can be as good a singer and guitarist as brett is but it is his commitment to the word that makes his song live and breathe his music has a playfulness in its bounce while the lyrics ring with a truth beyond his years
5352 as a dj ive been blessed to see many different people places and styles the album title represents all the bridges ive crossed worldwide
5353 the bridges of time cultures and colour the bridges of hip hop funk pop rock jazz punk disco and r amp b

5392 niciodata pina acum nu s a aflat vreun politician american in rol de candidat la presedintie in germania nu doar prezenta lui obama la coloana victoriei ci si convorbirile sale cu angela merkel si frank walter steinmeier ministrul de externe m a reprezinta o premiera cel putin in ce priveste sediul guvernului german
5393 cred c ar trebui sa ne bucuram ca vine un american impotriva caruia nu trebuie sa demonstrezi
5394 obama nu i un sfint si nimeni n ar trebui sa se astepte la minuni
5395 obama n are o parere foarte progresista nici in privinta pedepsei cu moartea nici in privinta posesiei de arme si a politicii de sanatate
5396 candidatul sau oricare alt candidat va fi ales presedinte bun venit din inima in fata portii brandenburg
5397 ati spus mereu ca zvonurile precum ca ati fi musulman n ar avea nimic de a face cu comunitatea islamica multi se ntreaba insa de ce nu merge in cazul acesta nici macar o data intr o moschee in discursul dumneavoastra de la berlin ati cerut darimarea zidurilor dintre musulmani crestini si evrei atunci de ce nu va duceti intr o moschee
5398 ei candy nu pot sa le fac pe toate am facut cit de mult a fost posibil saptamina asta ramine cum am spus am cel mai mare respect pentru comunitatea religioasa musulmana unul din lucrurile pe care l as face anul viitor ca presedinte ar fi sa convoc o conferinta a tarilor islamice astfel ar putea fi deconstruite suspiciunea si neincrederea care s au adunat intre statele unite si lumea islamica avem nevoie de ajutorul tuturor oamenilor in special de cel din partea musulmanilor de buna credinta
5399 in calitate de presedinte al comisiei finante si banci din senat ar fi contribuit semnificativ la votarea unei legi inasprite de interzicere a investitiilor in iran faptul ca obama nu e nici macar membru al acelei comisii n a fost mentionat decit de niscaiva bloggeri si citeva ziare imaginile tv au fost mult prea frumoase mai ales acelea de la berlin
5400 sa se arate celor de acasa cind actualul presedinte vorbeste n strainatate oamenii protesteaza ma rog nu si n romania m a cind vorbeste obama jubileaza era de asteptat sa se ntimple asta la berlin nu in ultimul rind pentru ca relatia foarte emotionala dintre germani si americani se densifica aici berlinul este cutia de rezonanta a unor semnificatii istorice ca loc a doua mari victorii ale americanilor asupra nazistilor si asupra sovieticilor berlinul este un cod un loc pe care cu greu il mai gasesti unde amestecul american in afacerile restului lumii este privit ca ceva binecuvintat
5401 reverend wright is not the man i thought i knew
5402 mccains ideology resembles an exotic cocktail of teddy roosevelt barry goldwater and ronald reagan
5403 the only republican who could win against either obama or clinton would be him
5404 and ye will not suffer allow your children that they go hungry or naked neither will ye suffer that they transgress the laws of god and fight and quarrel one with another and serve the devil who is that master of sin or who is the evil spirit which hath been spoken of by our fathers he being an enemy to all righteousness but ye will teach them to walk in the ways of truth and soberness ye will teach them to love one another and to serve one another

5408 este o mare greseala sa spui ca ne aparam titlul olimpic da romania a cistigat medaliile de aur la atena in 2004 dar era o alta echipa atunci
5409 de la echipa mea nu astept nimic fetele incearca sa faca o figura buna cit mai buna posibila competitia creeaza rezultate vom vedea ce se va intimpla la final
5410 astept de la ea sa lucreze cit mai bine vom vedea ce face la momentul competitiei este in forma si nu are probleme cu nici o accidentare
5411 in masura in care aceste rezultate ar face sa planeze cel mai mic dubiu asupra lor le vom repeta iar daca rezultatele vor fi pozitive atunci nu vor merge la beijing
5412 dupa cazul lilianei popescu ans si cosr au hotarit sa se faca niste teste la un laborator ultramodern din lausanne daca elena antoci si cristina vasiloiu s au dopat atunci sportivii romani ar trebui sa rasufle usurati pentru ca aceste cazuri au fost prevenite inainte de a intra in concurs
5413 last year the rough here was almost out of control this year the rough is very average and its part of an experiment theyre doing theyre trying to see if the rough height has any effect on scoring

5415 you fall in love with a golf course when you have a setup thats as wonderful as this
5416 the greens are fast the pin placements are great the rough is challenging but fair and it lets you hit some recovery shots this year firestone is one of my favourite golf courses that we have on tour

5420 otelul isi mentine decizia sustine inlocuirea lui mircea sandu pentru ca s a confruntat cu mari probleme la comisiile federatiei in sezonul trecut
5421 din pacate asta e mare problema desi multi vrem sa il schimbam pe sandu nu gasim un inlocuitor nu pentru ca lumea fotbalului nu ar fi capabila sa conduca o federatie dar pentru asta iti trebuie experienta relatii si sa fii bine vazut la ora actuala nu se gaseste un inlocuitor capabil pentru mircea sandu

5474 state and local agencies save and recover billions for consumers every year but its difficult for them to keep up with the demand to stop marketplace abuses resolve individual complaints and educate people to avoid rip offs
5475 in economic hard times consumers are even more vulnerable to phony promises to help them financially or money making schemes
5476 state and local consumer protection agencies are the first responders whether its a man made disaster such as the mortgage crisis or a natural disaster like a hurricane or wildfires
5477 in addition to having to be experts in everything from auto repairs to gem stone grading state and local consumer agencies also need expertise to deal with the evolving nature of fraud especially online

5489 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic the way they acted was extraordinary
5490 i never took the time to know him but he seemed to be ok right just a kid
5491 he just said he was going to winnipeg going home thats where he was from
5492 he must have stabbed him 50 times or 60 times
5493 like just everywhere arms legs neck chest guts wherever he could swing it he got it
5494 it looked kind of like a scuffle or an argument you know and then somebodys like knife knife run so i was running up the alleyway slapping people telling them to get going move get off the bus i got pushed over some lady got pushed over i was just making sure everybody was ok and we all got off the bus
5495 the attacker was over top of the victim continually cutting him i think the victim was gone at that point
5496 when we came back on the bus it was visible at the end of the bus he was cutting the guys head off and pretty much gutting him up
5497 while we were watching the door he calmly walks up to the front with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
5498 they did an awesome thing holding him in there because if not what would have happened
5499 it was like he was at the beach or something there was no rage in him he wasnt swearing or cursing or anything it was just like he was a robot or something
5500 while we were waiting on the side of the road the attacker was taunting the police with the head in his hand
5501 i closed my eyes and i seen him in the window there just like a madman
5502 when you see something as horrifying as that the brain locks on to those images its very difficult to release those images
5503 the assistance that people will get will be along the lines of coping in the immediate phase learning what to do to reduce the profound effect this experience will have
5504 they will experience very very vivid flashbacks of that occurrence those will usually dissipate over a period of time but right now its going to be very vivid as theyre still dealing with the shock and processing this horrific event
5505 theres not a right or wrong way to go through this some people will still be in shock and being very flat in presentation like nothings happened other people may not get out of bed and not want to move for a while or be having what we call very acute responses so theyll be maybe crying and not wanting to calm down at all everybodys going to go through this very difficult journey in a very different way
5506 the horrific nature of it is probably one of a kind in canadian history
5507 i can assure people that everything is in full motion and momentum to getting to the bottom of this incident
5508 all we can do is physically observe the individuals behaviour but obviously the item of destruction got on the bus somehow and if it was visible to any driver he would not have boarded the bus just for that simple reason
5509 there has to be some reactive measures taken whether it be metal screening or whether we design differently our loading policies at various depots so you have to funnel down a chute as your only way onto the bus at major terminals i really believe now we have to do something not only that we have to be investigating carry on luggage and certain things like that
5510 we are working with transport canada to review inter city bus security
5511 due to the rural nature of our network airport type security is not practical for bus travel its just a completely different system

5533 from the 17th of tamuz the tzaros of the churban started so the custom is to comport oneself a little like a mourner
5534 may hashem help us to weep and mourn the destruction of the beis hamikdash which principally means that we should mourn because of our sins that prevent the rebuilding of the beis hamikdash until we merit to change our agony and sighing into the happiness and joy of trust in hashems kindness and great deliverance until everything turns into good
5535 i will give you a big sum of money if you can find even one bochur who believes that it is possible to come to the level whereby one can go an entire year without sins i am not talking about trying to accept upon ourselves to go a year without sin quite the contrary kabalos have to be exclusively small but we must at least believe that this is possible after much introspection and toil i am not even talking about coming to gadlus which is a much greater level i am talking about entering into our heads and hearts the genuine belief that it is possible to rid ourselves of all sin this emunah is a prerequisite of true teshuvah which consists of charata of the past and acceptance for the future

5542 theres a philosophy that goes across all of our games and that philosophy stays true from game to game so it probably draws some comparisons
5543 one philosophy is that our artists feel like if theyre just using photorealism not creating a unique look for the game not stylizing so that its uniquely blizzard then theyre not doing their jobs
5544 if you do follow those rules theres going to be some similarities
5545 we dont say oh we dont want to do anything those games did its all blizzard were all a family wow pulled stuff from diablo ii if we think its a smart choice we try to pull stuff from them we dont really worry about whether its different what matters is does it make the gameplay better that always wins
5546 diablo can do a lot of things wow cant even do
5547 we cant do the level of violence that they can do in diablo iii we would lose our rating if we do the things that diablo iii does they have a much darker vibe
5548 if were actually making the game worse with no other reason than to be different from wow then its a bad choice we dont think when people play that theyll have any problem telling that its a different game
5549 we want to generate the feeling of everything getting worse its part of our narrative it makes the more gloomy part of the game a place where the stakes get higher

5612 i wish we could take credit for the number of deaths
5613 the writers damian shannon and mark swift after we had done everything said did you notice how many kills there were and we said yeah there are a lot they said actually there are 13 so the writers had figured that out
5614 we also show what jasons doing when hes not killing
5615 hes just great on it and people didnt know that its fun to watch
5616 our character has been rejected hes pulled away from society he wants to live by himself and all of a sudden these kids come into his area and disrespect his area and he has nowhere to go hes like a caged animal with his back against the wall and he albeit in a bad way protects himself
5617 my knees got pretty damaged i had some bad knee problems afterwards and it took me about four weeks to really recover from it it definitely isnt as campy as the original friday the 13th movies they were what they were for their day but when you look at them now you dont get as creeped out its a different feel i think the audiences are demanding a little bit more of horror movies now so ours is a lot of blood and guts and weapons and stuff like that
5618 ive been doing the character background the victimization of jason since he was abused as a child he was always the outcast
5619 he was always shunned by society so ive taken the stance that its almost like a vietnam flashback where someone has been victimized and abused so badly that when things resurface and these kids start to encroach on his area he is once again having a flashback its a moment so intense that hes getting his revenge for when he saw his mother get murdered hes still in the moment like these people just recently murdered his mother and hes having his revenge

5622 a lot of our movies i think have been more dreary and tended more towards what they call torture porn the scares are so scary but the scares are happening to kids that you love because you had a fun experience with them these are kids who are drinking smoking and having sex and its been a long time since youve seen that on the big screen were hoping that those two things coming together will give the audience a new experience with a horror movie
5623 i think at the end of the day it was one of those situations that caught me off guard

5625 the concept is to bring all the people together as one person linking as one world at the state of where the world is now with all these wars and conflict all over the place i think a record like that is needed thats the best time when a voice needs to be heard i felt like what better voice between me and mike to be able to say something like that at the time we in outside of trying to do a club record or a record we expect to get thousand of spins it was more so lets do a record that fits all formats but also has some meaning to it but of course for the future well be finishing up the rest of the record
5626 were gonna set up a whole tour around it its a big play
5627 she was mad cool down to earth yet conservative polite she felt like a high school friend she felt mad approachable cool as hell we had a great time working the chemistry was right on point the record shows it because we came up with a smash

5631 she really aint actually we switched some words around so people dont think she was singing about bobby this record is more of a record that anyone going through that situation would be able to relate to its just the fact that she got out of a situation is what made it more relevant im doing two records for her album

5634 on december 1st of 1981 where were emmett and rosalie that night at dinner
5635 but i mean i like everybodys verse because i think that lupe killed it kanye killed it mine was more about style than how dope the rhyme was it was really my melody that i liked more than anything thats why my vocal approach was a little different from what you would hear me do i wanted to just do something different that would look different on me
5636 the concept is based on old 80s video game graphics playing behind us while were rhyming

5659 theres a philosophy that goes across all of our games and that philosophy stays true from game to game so it probably draws some comparisons
5660 one philosophy is that our artists feel like if theyre just using photorealism not creating a unique look for the game not stylizing so that its uniquely blizzard then theyre not doing their jobs
5661 if you do follow those rules theres going to be some similarities
5662 we dont say oh we dont want to do anything those games did its all blizzard were all a family wow pulled stuff from diablo ii if we think its a smart choice we try to pull stuff from them we dont really worry about whether its different what matters is does it make the gameplay better that always wins
5663 diablo can do a lot of things wow cant even do
5664 we cant do the level of violence that they can do in diablo iii we would lose our rating if we do the things that diablo iii does they have a much darker vibe
5665 if were actually making the game worse with no other reason than to be different from wow then its a bad choice we dont think when people play that theyll have any problem telling that its a different game
5666 we want to generate the feeling of everything getting worse its part of our narrative it makes the more gloomy part of the game a place where the stakes get higher

5851 heroism on command senseless violence and all the loathsome nonsense that goes by the name of patriotism how passionately i hate them
5852 no this trick wont work how on earth are you ever going to explain in terms of chemistry and physics so important a biological phenomenon as first love
5853 my religion consists of a humble admiration of the illimitable superior spirit who reveals himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble mind
5854 yes we have to divide up our time like that between our politics and our equations but to me our equations are far more important for politics are only a matter of present concern a mathematical equation stands forever
5855 the release of atom power has changed everything except our way of thinking the solution to this problem lies in the heart of mankind if only i had known i should have become a watchmaker
5856 great spirits have always found violent opposition from mediocrities the latter cannot understand it when a man does not thoughtlessly submit to hereditary prejudices but honestly and courageously uses his intelligence
5857 the most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious it is the source of all true art and all science he to whom this emotion is a stranger who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe is as good as dead his eyes are closed
5858 a mans ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy education and social ties no religious basis is necessary man would indeeded be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death
