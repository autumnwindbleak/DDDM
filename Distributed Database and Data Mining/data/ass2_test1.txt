10 it is no longer feasible or affordable to purchase the most capable multi mission platform and then limit its use to execute tailored mission areas or focus on specific threats as asymmetric threats continue to evolve so will traditional threats the navy must find affordable and adaptable ways to fill current and future warfighting gaps
11 a capable ship which meets the requirements for which it was designed
12 the ddg 1000 cannot perform area air defense specifically it cannot successfully employ the standard missile sm 2 sm 3 or sm 6 and is incapable of conducting ballistic missile defense although superior in littoral asw the ddg 1000 lower power sonar design is less effective in the blue water than ddg 51 capability ddg 1000s advanced gun system ags design provides enhanced naval fires support capability in the littorals with increased survivability however with the accelerated advancement of precision munitions and targeting excess fires capacity already exists from tactical aviation and organic usmc fires unfortunately the ddg 1000 design sacrifices capacity for increased capability in an area where navy already has and is projected to have sufficient capacity and capability
13 for four weeks between may and june we had decc officers on 24 hour call in the field to respond to resident odour complaints and to monitor contributing factors such as location and wind
14 during the course of our investigations we located one industry where the odour controls were not working correctly and we are now making sure that the company rectifies this
15 both of these businesses are co operating with decc staff to help eliminate any potential contributions they may be making towards rutherfords odour issues and thats a very positive outcome
16 we were able to analyse four samples from our odour capturing canisters used during the survey however none of these came from residential areas and with the exception of the samples obtained from hunter water corporations sewer system were in fact typical of busy roads
17 based on the diversity of complaints both in odour types and location we knew that this would not be a simple matter of finding one single source instead it is most likely a combination of processes from a combination of industries
18 hopefully by working with the industries in rutherford to ensure that the correct odour controls are in place we can eliminate the offensive smells as much as possible
19 just notice your breath repeatedly constantly start with a few minutes do it regularly daily everyday no days off if you miss a day dont ruminate too much just pick it up and start again keeping it regular is very important it will bring order and a restfulness to your life off of the cushion as it were
20 i would like to speak a moment about this concept of community as a meditator you are not alone you are not selfish because you take the time to notice your thoughts in fact you will come to see if you sit with any real regularity and commitment that your time sitting will alter maybe even transform your life with others in very beneficial harmonious ways i do not want to give you the impression that everything will be perfect and pleasant henceforward no this is not any humans reality that i have met and i have met the lowest and the highest of the caste no i just wanted to make certain that you heard the report from the front lines as it were that you are not alone ever never no how
21 there is nothin like that crack of the bat at the park it is probably my favorite sound of the park its not the same on broadcast no matter what kind of system you put it through ambience echo cracker jacks i dont care if i ever get back
22 yah i picked this white one up last year i wear it when i think they are going to win i wear the grey when they are destined to lose i think ill have to wear the grey one more
23 so do you find you get more comments from people when you were either color
24 yah definetly the white one gets more guys staring at me those boys sneer occasionally at the grey one but the white one is more noticeable much more piratey looking if they ever drop the price on em or do another one hey maybe you and viv could do one with maybe less quality ah but youd probably go in the other direction and line em with sensors well maybe all i am saying is they could take off as a weird trend
25 exactly ok so what are your top ten fenway sounds today
26 in no particular order no wait i think i can order them
27 common ma can i get a coffee i am too old enough to drink
28 hey braid what can you tell me about the whereabouts of a guy named rockrock ring any bells
29 ya rockrock viv must have let on to you about the package i received the other day it was dropped in at her uncles place im not certain how anyone knew we were there but it was clearly for me for us and there was a picture the picture was of cocoa and me taken about a month ago
30 compro what no we were just having a snack down by the harbor
31 i mean anything technologically compromising like maybe how did that photo get taken without either of you knowing it was being taken that kind of compromising
32 oh yah well since you put it that way yes very compromising
33 oh in that instance yah i think i know who this rockrock person maybe
34 police are of the opinion that although the options of avos and the like are being pursued it will not deter those persons residing in willow drive from harassing the couple
35 police are fearful that the violence may get out of hand and the best way to avoid this is through relocation
36 vet tenants more thoroughly and not use our area as a dumping ground for troublemakers
37 but it wasnt like that for us last christmas when all my kids presents were broken or stolen and our house was damaged by fire
38 we had been out on christmas day returning to find our house had been trashed
39 we had been inside for only a few minutes before people began throwing bricks at the building
40 i ran out with my 18 month old baby in my arms my other children following
41 the taxi driver waiting for us was astonished at what was happening
42 our families are all safe now and i want nothing from anybody
43 but i feel i must speak up now or i will have it on my conscience forever if i keep quiet and someone is killed in willow drive
44 living there can be a nightmare and i feel so sorry for people who still live with all those troubles
45 i was targeted because i am against drugs so i became the worst person in the world to many people there
46 no one in the street will talk to police because they are so frightened
47 people are fighting all over the place and it is getting out of hand
48 the department of housing is putting bad people in here without checking on their past history
49 my idea of hell is being photographed so maybe we can consider this my therapy session but im really looking forward to seeing how the artists view me because hopefully theyll be kinder to me than i am on myself and thats part of the therapy
50 ive been listening to carol on the radio for years but ive never seen her so this has been a great experience
51 because when you listen to someone on the radio for quite some time you can get a preconceived idea of what the face on the end of that voice may look like
52 one of the things that makes it okay is that as opposed to being photographed youre being captured by someone else the only view of a photograph is the one you put on it yourself so this is my opportunity to see what other people see
53 also how often in life do you get to do something like this my reaction to the whole thing has been yes then no yes then no but its a great privilege i mean when was the last time someone rang up and said hey can i paint your head
54 and for people who have life long self esteem problems i think something like this helps even if they turn you inside out and flip you on your head
55 this is why i work in radio and not television
56 participants involved in this activity can look back proudly on their achievements knowing that their contribution created ongoing benefit to their community through assisting with the presentation and profile of a major tourist attraction of the hunter
57 get some training interact with other people and build their self esteem
58 the gaol is a state icon and the work for the dole project has not only been good for the participants in terms of giving them useful trade skills but its made an enormous contribution to the site
59 this course is slightly different its going to have a little more emphasis on problem solving and negotiation skills
60 it will give men better skills and strategies for resolving conflict so it doesnt escalate into something else
61 its for men in close domestic relationships through to men having problems in their workplace unemployed to professional people
62 younger men are more open to it i think its happening slowly
63 women are encouraged to talk about their feelings where men arent
64 this workshop will help men to identify and acknowledge what their feelings are
65 it was a bit of a surprise it just arrived
66 its a difficult thing for disability business services to market to the community because were so diverse and the community dont really have an understanding of what we do
67 the funding is a good recognition from the government that this is a worthwhile venture
68 disability services like mai wel need to market themselves and sometimes they have a limited capacity to do so
69 this is a one off grant to up their activity on the marketing side
70 this of course will hopefully grow their business and provide greater opportunities for them to expand
71 theres nothing more important in disability services than providing the challenge and opportunity to work in mainstream australia
72 the staff are very excited about going in as are the residents and the families
73 it brings us right up and into the 21st century
74 benhome provides a wonderful service to the local community and this further enhances what theyre able to do
75 all governments are appreciative of not for profit organisations like the one here helping to engage the local community in the financial support of these facilities
76 there shouldnt be any greater priority for government than to take care of elderly australians those who have contributed so much to the development of the nation
77 weve got a rapidly ageing population so governments generally are going to have to look in the future at investing more into aged care facilities
78 weve got an intergenerational challenge ahead of us to support older australians
79 it the care of elderly australians has to be a big focus theres no doubt that greater investments are required
80 when i started here 11 years ago we didnt have a call for it
81 about eight years ago it was identified and we put an eight bed unit in place

87 so do you know this rockrock person and what does the photo have to do with this
88 ya see back in the day i worked a few non commercial stations in new york boston and middle america this guy sounds pretty familiar but the degredation of the tape is muckin with my memory its throwing me off a bit it could have been a very good friend of mine using an alias and the tape warble is weird too ya know the whole alias alternate name thing that is the norm these days with so many folk in the online world was pretty much confined to terrestrial broadcast radio back then of course way back to the dawn of broadcast radio there were stage names and ghost writers but with radio the first mass electronic media fake names or alias were really something different the alive quality the live broadcast nature of the medium coupled with the intimacy of the audio in the ear of the listener really shifted persona frontin to a whole new realm
89 mr radio historia phila dr ya know could you just answer the question who is this guy
90 blaaaah ok so do you have any idea wait check that question how about will you be able to figure out who and what and why this recording was dropped here i mean it was literally airmailed and was that an eno track followed by firesign
91 well if that is me then why dont i remember
92 coop you had a pretty tough time out in california didnt you
93 well yah i suppose it was a tough year we flew and jumped a lot and i did hit the trees a few times more than i can ever remember doin in the past i think
94 well yah i would say that at least four or five times a season someone now not always someone sitting in my seats but someone within a few seats gets hit usually you dont see the blood but usually you dont have someone wearing a white silk top to the game silk really shows off blood
95 hey if you dont mind me asking braid how often do you sell your seats what you have had those season tickets for twenty or is it 30 years now
96 actually coop i only sit in my seats if it is the playoffs i sell or give away the seats to every regular season game i clear at least seventy six thousand a year selling the seats
97 yup it is a bit weahd but hey i actually prefer to stand and mill about during the game more action better people watching
98 well ya coop i been here a long time paid my dues sat through hundreds of games of sorrow with the sox have paid well maybe not hundreds but tens of thousands for tickets over the years keeping the season tickets in the fold and now well i deserve to make some of it back whilst the pink hats and silk patrons pay the gs for the seats
99 people watching indeed braid indeed get it while you can
100 hey can i have my antenna back im gettin a lot of echo
101 coop look i gotta go check on my patrons see if the silk splattered one is ok theyre calling me down hey let me just give ya a tip stay out of the tree climbing and try and dig up some of your old airchecks they will probably remind and jog a lot of memories for you and help explain the package delivery
102 you know where to find me and get rid of that wack snogue gear it cant be good for your rehab
103 hes been on the lam for four years and we were initially told he fled to mexico
104 from the information i got he was hiding keeping a very low profile
105 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
106 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
107 were excited because surprises are where discoveries come from one surprise is how the soil is behaving the ice rich layers stick to the scoop when poised in the sun above the deck different from what we expected from all the mars simulation testing weve done that has presented challenges for delivering samples but were finding ways to work with it and were gathering lots of information to help us understand this soil
108 its a 30 watt light bulb giving us a laser show on mars
109 the details and patterns we see in the ground show an ice dominated terrain as far as the eye can see
110 they help us plan measurements were making within reach of the robotic arm and interpret those measurements on a wider scale
111 ahh you know how it goes just lookin but thanks doll
112 you know i hear that hundreds of times a day but
113 she has a yankees tattoo she has a yankees tattoo

127 morning hopefully youll get to the bottom of this mystery
128 we are committed to ensuring that the products that come into america are safe for consumers and that the regulating agencies have what they need in order to do their job
129 we still have a few concerns but not enough that would keep us from signing the bill
130 so the president will sign that as soon as they can get it to us
131 i have a responsibility to ensure that our state has enough money to pay its bills this is not an action that i take lightly
132 i have nothing to eat son i have been sleeping without food for days
133 hope is the power that gives us the power to step out and try
134 do you think i ever woke up in the morning surveyed my apartment and said maybe ill crank the tunes and jump on my couch for a while i dont think so
135 amazing wonderful and in most cases untrue stories about myself
136 a prototypical child of the electronic age he knows how to use the sound bite he will give you a sentence that will be tailored for you to put into your news broadcast he is a child of the age in that sense
137 this path im on now is only something i arrived at after having fully explored my own dickiness
138 why certain undisclosed charities would give money to pay overhead for what is essentially a charitable conduit
139 williams insists that whenever a person gives money for a particular charity 100 per of that money gets to the named beneficiary that may be true but it does not mitigate the fact that the vast majority of the overall money collected during 2006 went to administration
140 we charge nothing for donations collected online and even cover the credit card costs associated with each donation we rely on the support of generous donors and advertisers to provide this service
141 we have a responsibility to scrutinize all charitable endeavours to ensure that we are getting decent value for our dollar
142 the point of this letter is to emphasize both the general and specific importance of all of us making the effort to sign up so that our organs may be used after our death by others for whom they can be the gift of life and for the extra courageous and hearty there are organ and bodily donations that can happen while we are alive many people wait on lists desperately hoping for this miracle and any of us may find ourselves or a close loved one in need at some point in ourlives the sad fact is that a small fraction of the population has signed up to make such donations possible at least by the laws in bc without that few moments of paperwork our body parts will simply go to the grave or crematorium that follows and sign up asap if you live in another jurisdiction take a few minutes and find out how you can do the same consider forwarding this email to your friends your facebook site your network post on your blog or however you prefer lets create a wave of donors
143 hey it looks like this package is somehow attached to the dog
144 this package that you dragged me out to see it has this weird filament attached to it and it is attached to the dog
145 hey this stringy stuff is really weird its like really super strong and almost feels like silk hey did spiderman drop this package off or something
146 censorship is anathema to the very spirit of the olympic games which celebrates diversity emphasizes mutual respect and demands dispassionate unadulterated representation of each competition
147 china had promised to provide media covering the games with the same access and freedoms enjoyed at all other olympic games
148 the ioc cannot sacrifice the olympic ideals in the name of harmony with its host city
149 a lot of the money raised by givemeaning ends in my pocket
150 i have stumbled from one business and personal failure to another
151 the problem with the bible is that its had too many wikipedia edits
152 indeed i did young man wow it was a classic really still to this day one of the best comebacks ever
153 you know i remember watchin the game back in the early summer of 08 and it was just devastating couldnt believe it i was there sittin behind and beside jack and he was just so damn quiet damn quiet and arms folded steaming i mean he was having his usual crackin time at the game but he was beside himself by the time the laker had lost their 24 point lead in the forth quarter lost the lead in their own house their own court jacks own hardwood drinkin bottled water i thought hed pull his barker out and start shootin up the joint
154 hey uncle ank would you like any coffee or juice this morning
155 aaah ok doll ill have some of that pomegran night and cranberry
156 ya pomegran night and cranberry man that ray allen he played the entire game that game and and he had one of the most beautiful smooth as pond ice isolation driving layups at the end of the game to totally empty la just gorgeous the iso started above the three point line so it really looked like hollywood movie type play unfortunately for la they cast the wrong guy to play one on one with in that game ray allen smooth
157 ok here is your juice ank so coop do you remember the game anks talkin about
158 well i remember the story celtics come back from a 20 something deficit in la in game four ray allen plays all 48 posey and house have huge contributions pierce and garnet their usual great and strong selves another amazing celtics lakers playoff game
159 oh come on coop it was not just another amazing playoff game
160 did you just say you were a competitive yoga fan cocoa
161 har har you were listening to me hey ank one of coops associated parachuted this package in this mornin and we are just dying to listen to this weird tape that came along with it do you mind
162 oh right right sorry to have interrupted kids ill take my juice and zilla and go see how the espalier are coming in
163 i asked as i adjusted the cart in the slot
164 said cocoa as she opened the silken wrap around her hips and let the sun shine in as we prepared to finally listen
165 yah i just found it looks kinda interesting and familiar
166 hey is that marblehead maybe around singing beach or is that
167 hey i know who and where that picture was taken
168 that photo you are cradling in your skimpily laced lap is
169 so coop which associate of yours would parachute a package to you on a sunday
170 well i know of a lot of people who would fancy the idea but those folks would be more interested in dropping bombs or incendiary devices which i guess could still be inside the package but there is only one person who would fashion a parachute from old radio station banners and drop it a total radio monkey but that person is dead or so i thought
171 yah lets open that after we get the food on the table i could kill for a plate of our eggs bacon and the asparagus what we have been waiting for for over what has it been two years three to eat from our own patch the package can wait a bit cant it
172 oh sure coop im not hungry anyway but you do look a bit pale you sure you ok that was quite a fall how is the new leg and ankle holding up
173 ok so can we now open that package that has been staring at me this whole dang breakfast
174 so coop is that it just a strange mix of shredded stuff
175 well that my lovely is a honest to goodness radio cart machine
176 a cart machine is a specialized auto cue quarter inch tape playing machine commonly used in radio broadcasting through the dawn of computer digital playing mechanisms
177 woe spock that is quite enough fine i get it so who and why would someone send you this thing
178 well i was known by some folk to have an uncommon love for the things
179 ok so coop honey why would someone send you one
180 just look at this thing it weighs about ten pounds it has real plastic buttons and it smells like a cybernetic dinosaur nice oil i bet this is pure marvelous oil in some ways these machines remind me of my 3g iphone
181 coop look my power points are getting burnt out here with all the uv today i just need to know if you need any help with anything else im about done hearing about the cart machine as it will be a while until you clue me into what led caused or who did this parachute drop thing you can unravel your package yourself unravel your package hey actually i think your own package may be getting burned out here too your kimono is a bit loose hon
182 would you look at the heads on this deck they are in good shape i wonder
183 umm ok why i didnt fall that hard really hey this cart machine is actually attached to a battery powered supply already and here is a cartridge
184 i do believe this is important that we dont make what is already a crowded and difficult environment for the traveling public and flight attendants
185 you are trying to legislate courtesy folks and that just doesnt work
186 it s easy to use and it offers a lot of applications
187 i can t wait to actually see it in use in the field
188 the real beauty of it is that the technology has been designed so that anyone who hasn t had any training on it can use it
189 the government of japan believes that stringent measures taken to relieve the two officers showed a serious stance from the u s side in regards to the fire
190 the government of japan understands that the navys investigation was conducted professionally and objectively
191 we are stunned and cant help feeling shivers going down our spines
192 for local stuff i dont drive as much ill get on a train
193 ill take the free garrison bus from panzer casern to patch barracks to do grocery shopping
194 my kids take the bus whenever they need to go to the hub a teen hangout at patch barracks or to a movie
195 you do quite a bit of driving when you live out here
196 i havent noticed us cutting down we have a hybrid for our other car and that helps
197 well never see 2 a gallon again id be happy to see 3
198 by pricing gas using a market based system were able to be more consistent with gas prices
199 taking into consideration the spiking price of oil and the weak value of the dollar to the euro this surcharge is being reviewed
200 we will make every effort to ensure the surcharge is the amount required to cover overhead costs nothing more nothing less
201 and if they thought there was any profit theyd be on us like a ton of bricks
202 we are purchasing the fuel in euros and the overhead costs often are paid in euros
203 please take into consideration whilst the price of oil increases the purchasing value of the dollar has decreased 37 percent in five years on our side had the dollar remained as it were five years ago we would be paying 37 percent less
204 we kept the patient comfortable with high doses of antibiotics and painkillers but medevac was the only option we had for definitive treatment
205 network comprised of machines under the control of a single user
206 criminal activity such as spam e mail identity theft denial of service attacks and spreading malware to other machines on the internet
207 i havent seen any reservations canceled yet that we have made
208 it is quite a busy time but most of the carriers we use are american carriers anyway
209 for the temporary duty or transferring travelers hopefully they will be ok when going to the states
210 maybe later if the strike keeps going it could be worse
211 years of inaction at the dod continue to speak volumes about senior leaderships commitment to our servicemembers and civil servants
212 when it comes to sexual assault in the military the dod has absolutely no credibility
213 even one sexual assault violates the very essence of what it means to be a soldier
214 i can assure you the army treats this very very seriously
215 civilians are not afforded the same protections as active duty military personnel after suffering an assault
216 if i knew then what i know now i cant say for sure i would have reported it
217 we keep thinking that the dod would get it by now but they dont
218 were looking at about a 2 billion price tag for relocation and building an entirely new line
219 if you add more train miles to a route for the railroad youll make trucking more attractive than railroad service so if thats the case youll have more trucks on the roads and people dont want to see that
220 this was a pretty serious safety issue that we are going to correct
221 loss of confidence in his ability to command and his failure to meet mission requirements and readiness standards
222 we found cigarette butts where we shouldnt have found them
223 the fire and the subsequent magnitude of the fire were the result of a series of human acts that could have been prevented
224 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
225 americans want a respectful campaign people say negative ads move numbers they may but do we have to go to the lowest common denominator i dont think so
226 we need to provide ore to the construction side of the operation to then commission the plant
227 we shouldve by now already started that process but because of the delay in terms of relocating the power diversion around this property we now are out of kilter with what it is we should be doing in preparation for the mining
228 it is wonderful to see many grape varieties collecting medals indicating the region can produce wine that is as good as any in australia
229 i congratulate peter and anne jeffery of spring ridge on their trophy for the best chardonnay of the show which has consolidated cowras position as one of the top chardonnay regions in australia
230 the best local wine of the show went to a shiraz and silver medals were won by viognier and semillon among the bronze medals we had a merlot cabernet sauvignon chardonnay shiraz shiraz viognier verdelho and a chardonnay semillon blend
231 bathurst forming a menshed in bathurst is a good idea
232 we have seen our membership jump from 30 members to 80 and many have formed great friendships
233 we would like to see the youth come here and we could teach them how to build and create things we are looking to do an outreach course with tafe so people can learn how to use computers and we may have work for the dole people come here as well
234 you can really see the progression the involvement and desire by the members to help young people is just fantastic and almost seems like a natural thing for groups like menshed to do
235 we have received several grants and some of that money will be used to purchase new computers
236 while its hot and dry the water supply level is very solid
237 most people dont realize the impact cattle has on the state economy
238 its the largest agricultural industry in the state and right now theres a rise in ranchers who feel they need to cut their losses
239 he told me he hadnt played offensive line since middle school i tell you what junior guard nick charles and a couple of those older kids have done a good job just kind of crash coursing him
240 he can move and he can bend and hes aggressive
241 it gives him a little bit better chance to play
242 i just dont think you can have a bunch of quarterbacks i think youve got to pick who your top two or three are and those are the guys you need
243 weve got a lot of young guys so theres going to be a lot of anticipation a lot of guys ready to step up and play
244 so theres definitely a lot of emotion going around so thats good
245 this group will have a great work ethic and this group will have a great spirit about it
246 now what weve got to do is get to the point where we play well
247 this time last year we had a lot of them that were absolutely clueless because everything was new
248 just the difference a year makes in the system were light years from where we were terminology wise and mentally
249 youre able to get into a lot more detail sooner
250 last year you were just trying to teach them the big picture where at least now theyve got a little bit of a grasp of it and you can be a little more thorough

258 no it cant be real i was in my flat last moment i remember no it cant be true how can i
259 ohh its just my mobile i threw on the niks bed
260 ohh i was about to tell you mom rohan just called me and asked to come to his room he has some new cds
261 i wonder if it hurts when i throw them at her
262 i will be there in few more minutes aadi please wait for me
263 how come you didnt notice me coming this time aadi
264 keeper ja da er du faktisk den andre keeperen vi har hatt her oppe p scenen som har triksa men det er kanskje ikke s trygt ha en keeper som trikser for da pluttselig s stor du der og trikser i m l og pluttselig s bare v
265 s gjorde han s nn greier med armer og bein og jeg fikk s j vlig latterkrampe oppe p scenen xd haha
266 i remember when bernard hopkins was challenging me and at that time i was a welterweight and he was fighting as a light heavyweight and he called me out
267 as a fighter i felt i had to challenge him so i did now manny pacquiao is challenging me and i am definitely considering it
268 we were watching an espn 2 show a few weeks ago and they mentioned that brian minto amp kevin johnson were two of the top five american heavyweights but eddies name wasnt on the list come on now minto couldnt hit eddie with a handful of rice
269 i started bernard hopkins and i managed former super middleweight champion steve little and eddie has more natural talent than anyone i have managed
270 i see guys like ruiz valuev toney amp barrett getting opportunity after opportunity and that shuts out guys like me who lost one fight that i know i could have and should have won
271 james is a very fan friendly fighter whose body attack alone makes him entertaining every time out his vast wealth of amateur experience provides a solid foundation for him hes the type of fighter who adds value to every card he appears on
272 i love his body punching when you combine that with his tenacity in the ring it is hard to imagine him ever being in a bad fight
273 that shows me that james is a real fighter i hope to do lots more fights with him in the future he was willing to get right back on the horse against a guy who is not a pitty pat opponent
274 james is a very rugged and crowd pleasing fighter he sells a lot of tickets and has a lot of enthusiastic fans he generates excitement
275 theres no doubt that james can come back and be a world champion someday hes very strong willed and has a ton of guts and determination ill be rooting for him hes a dynamite fighter and a great guy
276 this time last year i was supposed to be fighting a legitimate ex champ in kassim ouma on a pay per view undercard
277 that fight got cancelled but this time im in against a more respected ex champ in vernon forrest a future hall of famer and our fight is the co feature so its an even bigger fight
278 this time around were fighting on my side of the tracks which means ill come with more aggression and more machismo i know vernon will come with more hunger but im a young hungry undefeated champion now and im going to stay that way
279 he fought a great fight but he fought a vernon forrest who was at 45
280 i had a bad night that night i had a terrible night the worst of my career it was like i was fighting in quicksand but on sept 13th mora will fight the vernon forrest he expected in june ill be at 100
281 everyone who faces me says that the truth is that i have a difficult style and they find that out first hand when they fight me
282 all his style did was make for an ugly stinky fight to watch and it was even more ugly to participate in it takes two to make a good fight and i couldnt give anything to make it a good fight i felt like i stunk out the joint that night
283 its a misconception that i got old or that i took him lightly
284 this time ill limit how much ill train for the fight
285 i could have done more in the first fight because i knew what he was going to do its just that physically i couldnt adapt to what he did after four rounds i had nothing
286 hes a master at holding without the referee seeing he holds and he tries to headbutt and elbow on his way in he even kneed me in the chest during one clinch thats why i hit him behind the head so i could draw attention from the ref vernon knows every trick in the book
287 i think its going to be a more exciting fight this time
288 i see in his eyes that i hurt his pride by beating him
289 im going to be more aggressive im going to throw more right hands and go to the body im not going to hold back like i did the first time its mexican independence day weekend so i dont mind being a little macho or spilling a little blood
290 i knew it was going to happen the eventual stoppage of cotto ive sparred with margarito for years sometimes he has good days sometimes i have good days but its always a war with him
291 i remember the first time i sparred with him was in 1999 in oscar de la hoyas camp for ike quartey
292 its been our goal to continue to bring exciting las vegas style boxing to this area since the beginning five years ago we have worked tirelessly to entertain the great boxing fans of this area by putting together some of the most exciting fights out there this saturday will be a culmination of all the hard work we have put forth these past five years we are going to pay our respects to the past of one in a million and look towards the future
293 she knows about it people have told her but she hasnt seen it and she doesnt plan to
294 shes on tour with benji madden and isnt watching television and has not been on the internet
295 but shes already said shes not too happy about it
296 i have fought some rough and tough fighters but hes the dirtiest fighter there is
297 there was no way he was gonna beat me anyway
298 i was too smart too fast too experienced if i kept on hitting him i would have killed him
299 if perry thinks that hector did something illegal then it should be taken to appeal
300 he does absolutely anything to get you off your game
301 he head butted me so much i have a crack in the front of my skull
302 the video and my medical records will vindicate me 100 percent
303 and there you see him hit cotto when hes on the ground
304 you know that tito wouldnt have went out like that

311 come into his bedroom uninvited to harass and start arguments
312 forcefully by the arm held him against his will and did not let him get away from her

321 last year the rough here was almost out of control this year the rough is very average and its part of an experiment theyre doing theyre trying to see if the rough height has any effect on scoring
322 im not saying its playing easy but the rough is not nearly as thick as it was last year
323 you fall in love with a golf course when you have a setup thats as wonderful as this
324 the greens are fast the pin placements are great the rough is challenging but fair and it lets you hit some recovery shots this year firestone is one of my favorite golf courses that we have on tour

334 hellboy is a character who is going someplace and i can hint about where hes going but i cant let you see it yet
335 he is not a filmmaker who is going to be slavish to the source material
336 my idea is that hellboy has been all over the world
337 i try not to write myself into a corner and allow things to expand even now every book i do im throwing certain pieces out there
338 we hit the level of shakespearean melodrama that i was really pleased with
339 theres a bit in christmas underground where an old ladys dying theres this one panel where hellboy puts his hand on top of her hand because he knows shes going to die and he knows theres nothing he can do about it and the best he can do is hold her hand

365 there is going to be a relaxing of the dress protocols and people are being encouraged to wear lighter clothing
366 i dont want to get involved in the fashion police of determining exactly what people can wear but the encouragement of business casual is where we are going
367 we have not accepted any of the proposals the government is now getting organised this is a normal process
368 this is not a question for me but for the prime minister it is the prime minister who is shaping the government
369 it is not my place to say how long this will take
370 this is not expected to have a negative impact on kyoto implementation
371 the focal point for kyoto questions remains the economy ministry as far as i know that hasnt changed
372 everybody sees china as this monster polluter but it is doing so much more than that
373 china is already leading in certain types of technologies in the power sector it is in clean coal solar wind in transport it is developing more efficient compact cars and electric cars
374 developed countries really need to demonstrate their sincerity demonstrate the feasibility of the solutions really demonstrate that they are serious about this
375 telling developing countries that they must do it when they themselves are not is just not acceptable
376 in china the top leadership are all of the same mindset china opened up 30 years ago but our economic miracle was driven by intense resource use that produced great pollution and recently unrest
377 that is fully understood the leadership has been thinking about a new pathway they know they cant repeat the path of the past they know it has to be clean it has to be more efficient low carbon has now been integrated into this new pathway
378 china has got the green message companies are making profits in pushing forward the low carbon economy
379 the thinking in china is that there is no doubt that in 20 or 30 years time china will be a world leader
380 if you can only have energy when the sun is shining youre in deep trouble and thats why in my opinion photovoltaics havent penetrated the market
381 if i could provide a storage mechanism then i make energy 24 7 and then we can start talking about solar
382 i can turn sunlight into a chemical fuel now i can use photovoltaics at night
383 opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
384 on the oxygen side it doesnt work well and you have to put way more energy in than needed to get the oxygen out
385 its cheap its efficient its highly manufacturable its incredibly tolerant of impurity and its from earth abundant stuff
386 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
387 obamas solution to americas energy crisis is inflating tires maybe hes been out of the country too long
388 running a tire 20 percent underinflated only 5 to 7 pounds per square inch psi can increase fuel consumption by 10 percent that can easily cost motorists two or three miles per gallon not only that but running underinflated also reduces the tires tread life
389 why do they act that way a survival guide to the adolescent brain for you and your teen
390 i know our generation is going to make it through life with jobs and being financially stable val but i worry about the children
391 you and i have made it growing up through the depression as children ourselves and as young adults through a world war our own parents certainly had cause to worry about us too
392 our kids will survive adapt to their surroundings and thrive in love and life as much as fate permits
393 im so excited im so anxious this is what ive been waiting for for a year
394 out of the two years weve been married we spent 5 months together
395 go to the beach with him go to chuck e cheeses and busch gardens
396 because we are not used to this kind of event just the gruesomeness of it is a bit like experiencing an earthquake the ground beneath you psychologically never feels quite secure again
397 people get so caught up in the memories of it it just affects who they are on a day to day basis
398 my government blew through my doors and killed my dogs
399 they thought we were drug dealers and we were treated as such i dont think they really ever considered that we werent
400 only celebrities like barack obama demand bottles of an organic brew black forest berry honest tea
401 i do have to ask my opponent is that the best you can come up with is that what is worthy of the american people
402 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
403 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
404 he can inspire the country to greatness this tomfoolery needs to stop
405 because we have research and development expertise and focus on 10 disease states
406 i dont think wed like to be exclusively biotech but were certainly moving more in that direction
407 there are an awful lot of biotechs with market capitalizations under 1 billion
408 we are reviewing it and once weve had a chance to do that well consider whether the decision should be appealed
409 ill vote for obama because we need a democrat in the white house
410 the best way that we can stand up for you is to make sure we have a democratic president taking the oath of office on jan 20 2009
411 seen his passion his determination his grace and his grit
412 there are a lot of folks still on the sidelines trying to make up their minds
413 if were going to have a president that respects unions
414 theres quite a few of us on the fence im not the only one a lot of her supporters are there
415 right now obama is saying shes low on the list well decide what to do if he doesnt choose her
416 i was thinking she would win and she slid back and i was really disappointed
417 i definitely want to see a democrat in the white house
418 he wasnt my first choice but thats the choice now
419 she stood strong and tall and im glad shes supporting barack obama
420 she has integrity and shes a lady of her word
421 they have to focus on electing a democrat mccain is not union friendly
422 if youre electing him youre putting bush back in the white house
423 weve now touched it and tasted it and id like to say that it tastes very fine
424 there were a lot of champagne corks popping in the downlink room last night
425 the extended mission will be time to explore other areas within reach of our robotic arm
426 were very pleased to see we landed right on top of water ice
427 this is good news for us the ice could have been around us but not near or right under us we hope to be able to answer the question is this a
428 although many things have changed you will always be reighs father and i will always be reighs mother
429 we both love her dearly and have only her best interests and well being in our hearts i ask you now please please bring snooks back
430 there has to be a better way for us to solve our differences than this way
431 we didnt have a lot of time to get it done so it tends to move a lot faster the last 24 hours i was surprised they obviously had a need for another bat in their lineup and a need for another outfielder i know white sox gm kenny williams had interest in junior in the past and looked at this as a good opportunity to add him to his club
432 he thought about it and said he wanted to talk to his family about it i think its a very good opportunity for him they obviously wanted him pursued him and came after him thats got to be a good feeling for him i guess
433 it was a lot more brief than i thought it was going to be
434 it was kind of shocking all of sudden bam it was done he is still going to be a friend of mine im upset that hes leaving but its a good situation for him he wants to win a ring the white sox are in first place and he has a chance
435 he wasnt having his best year but he was just getting hot
436 you wont be able to fill those shoes no one is ken griffey jr its the end of an era in cincinnati he got hurt a lot but was one of the top five best to ever step on the field
437 hes one of the best four or five hitters in baseball
438 i like him yet he marches to his own drummer i had him in the all star game it doesnt make sense to me that he would be available
439 we had some things that we were looking at that we were trying to improve mainly with the pen and we did that with rhodes
440 we were trying to add catching depth and we banged on i think every door if we didnt its our fault as far as any other opportunities yes there were other opportunities that we wanted to explore because we like to be active with the minutes ticking we wanted to take advantage of it why some of those things didnt come to fruition could be a number of factors it could be the money the players to somebody else had different goals than we did
441 we had conversations that went right down to the wire
442 and whenever you have that obviously you feel like theres a chance but it takes two teams and by definition trades are difficult to make and weve worked extremely hard the last couple of weeks to try and find a pick and improve the team but at the end of the day we didnt find something that lined up for us
443 i know there was a lot out there the way we view that is that the trade deadline is an opportunity for us to examine ways to improve our club we did that we had a lot of discussions a few of them led right up to the deadline but obviously nothing came to fruition
444 we exchanged proposals in a couple of instances but nothing to the point were i was calling owner tom hicks for the final signoff
445 the last four or five days obviously weve been in a lot of discussions and a lot of meetings and talked over a lot of different scenarios
446 but we were never real close to what i would call making a deal
447 tell you one thing and behind your back they do another thing
448 for the first time we may have a highly useful model of postpartum depression
449 the new research also points to a specific potential new target in the brain for medications to treat this disorder that affects 15 percent of women after they give birth
450 after giving birth female mice deficient in the suspect protein showed depression like behaviors and neglected their newborn pups
451 giving a drug that restored the proteins function improved maternal behavior and reduced pup mortality
452 improper functioning of the delta subunit could impair the gaba systems ability to adapt to hormone fluctuations during the highly vulnerable post partum period
453 targeting this subunit might be a promising strategy in developing new treatments for postpartum depression
454 were eating this same produce in mexico and we havent had any problems
455 reuters is carrying an article about a recent mit development which may pave the way for solar energy to be collected for use in low input periods
456 with our catalyst almost 100 percent of the current used for electrolysis goes into making oxygen and hydrogen
457 though until i hear a confirmation of mits findings from another university respected source i hold on to my severe doubts about this
458 with our catalyst almost 100 percent of the current used for electrolysis goes into making oxygen and hydrogen
459 noceras catalyst is made from cobalt phosphate and an electrode that produces oxygen from water by using 90 percent less electricity than current methods which use the costly metal platinum
460 its always a tough decision when you leave an organization like detroit
461 it was a wonderful ride for 15 years i spoke with all the people i worked with including the ownership and they understand the situation is an opportunity to come to chicago to be with stan
462 when i first started with the blackhawks it was in the back of my mind but i kind of set it aside and wanted to go about and get my career in motion
463 the free agent signings of the blackhawks caught my attention but you also have to develop your own players
464 i can be another set of eyes for dale and denny and the organization
465 with the outdoor game against detroit everything kind of goes together
466 im really looking forward to getting this thing to where it should be
467 look hes doing well and i have done well in the past
468 this year was hard i guess with the start of the year but nevertheless i still think its been a good year i just hope i can show it now at the olympics and the u s open
469 im looking forward for the next two tournaments those are really the ones that can make this season from a good one to a great one again
470 i already played against him six times and it was always close so i knew that im going to have a chance today
471 i dont think american tennis is troubled by any means but the way it is right now the best players in the world are from switzerland and spain
472 to be honest i didnt think that it would happen in this tournament because last week i played really bad
473 and i was injured before so i didnt do nothing basically for two weeks
474 its tough to beat a guy like that with a second serve
475 we believe the case will be solved if we can find this man
476 even if they arrest me what could they charge me with they have been on a month long fishing expedition and not caught any fish
477 i dont expect this case to be solved any time soon
478 with full support from azizah as well as the pas and dap leadership and our friends in permatang pauh i am offering myself as an mp for the constituency
479 actually selangor menteri besar tan sri khalid ibrahim had offered bandar tun razak so did azmin ali with his gombak seat they are all safe seats including the one in kulim
480 if it looks very safe please convey that to umno
481 where hydro power is concerned zambia has a lot of potential as for biofuels there are several types of crops that can be turned into fuel
482 we have found zambia to have potential it has political stability and leadership that is committed and farsighted it also has a wealth of resources
483 i believe there is a good opportunity for malaysia to be involved in zambias growth
484 there are several major projects to be implemented in zambia first of all the government wants to make lusaka a cargo hub it also wants to build an inland port and a transportation corridor linking the country with major ports in africa
485 there is also the plan for a multi functional trade zone this trade zone will not only have factories but also research and development facilities
486 the investigation papers have been submitted to the chambers for further action but i do not know the contents
487 no doubt i am the minister in charge but i am not in the habit of finding out the contents because that is not my job
488 let the due processes take place under the law anwar is innocent until proven guilty
489 there should be no talk about charges or him being arrested
490 the police have completed their investigations and the papers have been submitted
491 it is up to the chambers to decide whether to press charges against him or not
492 conducting a trial for the public to make a decision on the case
493 i think when you have a mob court it will be very difficult to uphold justice
494 islamic tourism is a niche market which is growing in volume and significance in challenging times we need to adjust accordingly and take into account the global economic environment
495 your initiative to push for islamic tourism is an idea whose time has come
496 it wasnt really fair for him ivan that he didnt play in the glass court before this i could see he was struggling in the glass court he was seeing the ball quite slow
497 furthermore permatang pauh is anwars home base which his wife pkr president datuk seri dr wan azizah wan ismail won even in 2004 at the height of bns popularity
498 she has failed the rakyat she has proven she is unfit to serve the people
499 the people can see for themselves our contributions pr has done nothing they have not helped the malays especially those in the rural areas
500 everyone has been talking about the discussions and their opinions are varied i fear we may go astray from the original objectives of the talks
501 that is why i think we should let the leaders of both parties hold formal meetings to discuss matters of importance to umno and pas
502 we could discuss fundamental issues such as religion and leave politics out
503 such moves would only lead us to lose focus and force us to talk on old issues that have been a hindrance to closer relations between umno and pas
504 if all is made known then it would become discussions via the media
505 there is no basis for the state assembly to demand such a thing
506 what right do they have to ask the federal government to pay them for the projects
507 this is all just a political ploy by pakatan rakyat
508 i am disgusted that tony blair has been invited to malaysia this man to me is a war criminal through instigating the war in iraq he has killed more than former bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic and saddam hussein
509 saddam has been hanged karadzic was recently arrested but this man goes around the world lecturing on the rule of law
510 it is great to be back here this is my favourite country the people are friendly and very giving with their smiles
511 it depends on how often we eat out usually its once or twice every weekend
512 its better to go to regular sellers they recognise you and will keep the prices reasonable
513 it further alleged that i had sold out and compromised gerakan the terms sold out and compromised the party essentially means that i have betrayed the party and cannot be trusted with the leadership of gerakan
514 i just dont know how a book that tells the gerakan story can be interpreted as an attempt to defame someone
515 we fully support anwar and the party will mobilise its machinery to ensure his victory
516 i was informed about this development much earlier we will support him all the way
517 i have lost twice i dont think the party will field me again
518 i am a fighter i will fight for whoever the party fields as a candidate
519 i have no problems with ezam former anwar ibrahim aide and pkr youth chief ezam mohd nor contesting the seat i think he will be a good candidate
520 even the performance of the penang government since the elections is an issue
521 we call it rezeki harimau we sometimes get a good catch or none at all i will spend more on groceries whenever i get siakap seabass or kerapu garoupa in big quantities
522 we will keep more of these items before the rainy season my wife knows very well when to stock up on groceries
523 i have to do it as i want my family to have good meals every day
524 we have gone through hard times when there was no food at home i dont want my children to beg for food from relatives again
525 theres nothing much to buy except fresh produce and items like milo and condensed milk
526 it may raise eyebrows but my husband and children sometimes want to try other types of fish particularly selayang and kembong
527 these types of fish are cheaper compared to stingray siakap and kerapu that my husband catches its better for him to sell the fish as we can get more money
528 pas rejects any form of cooperation with umno or bari san nasional at state or federal level we will not be forming any government with them this is no longer an issue
529 there is nothing secretive any more we can have meetings and the party would be notified of the meetings all this while the party had been informed of the meetings
530 we want uthayakumar to say that the medicine he had with him appeared in the police search list but it was missing in the detention centres list
531 he had the medicine when he was moved there we are dealing with a mans life
532 the court is ready to hear it and so is the senior federal counsel but you are giving all sorts of excuses
533 if you want this man to be either set free or admitted to a hospital you should proceed now if this was a civil court and you didnt follow the case management directions i would have thrown this case out it is a waste of time to file more affidavits
534 the idea is to put it all into written submissions because there are too many affidavits
535 as it is the court has been pushed and pressured just to suit lawyers
536 i admit that i did it but i did not intend to threaten
537 this is a serious offence you have taken advantage of a familys grief your action has caused them a lot of worry
538 the court is not here just to give out punishments it is also to teach lessons
539 he earns an income of rm450 and supports his four school going siblings he is remorseful of his action and will not do it again
540 he could be thinking that as the former member of parliament there he would still enjoy good support from voters dr wan azizah took over the seat from anwar and she is now giving way to him
541 we expected him to contest in permatang pauh although previously anwar said he might stand in bandar tun razak or kulim bandar baharu this shows that he has been misleading the people
542 i do not think permatang pauh is really a safe seat for anwar taking into consideration all the controversies involving him at present
543 having a by election involves a lot of work at this time we should be focusing on solving the problems faced by the people and not on pursuing ones personal ambitions
544 they are treating permatang pauh as a family playground where they can simply pass the baton as and how they like
545 maybe we should identify a new candidate and not someone who had previously contested there and lost what is important is that he or she must be a party member
546 umno has gone through various challenges i believe that our machinery would be able to fight against anwar
547 in the march general election the voters did not reject umno totally what we have to do is to convince them as to why they must support umno and barisan nasional
548 the general election was just held five months ago barisan nasional would give a strong fight this time around as now the prime minister datuk seri abdullah ahmad badawis leadership is more stable
549 we in mic are also stronger with our continuous rebuilding and we will give our full support to ensure victory
550 even if anwar wins it will not make any difference as barisan nasional would still continue to rule the country
551 but when i read these right finger i always carefully consider the good price because i can always get the s ads and the retailers descriptions
552 ive lost 30 pounds i really like the new me
553 my weight loss started off modestly but once i invested in the leanology shakes and capsules the weight started to peel off over the next five months i lost 30 pounds and i have managed to keep it off ever since
554 i went down to 160 pounds i truly feel terrific
555 i once thought of myself as lean but now felt heavy
556 ive lost 27 pounds total im really sold on leanology
557 i began taking leanology in june 2007 and it only took me three months to achieve my desired weight of 145 pounds a loss of 27 pounds i couldnt believe it i had tried many different weight loss programs in the past but they just would stop working after a point and i couldnt lose any more weight with leanology however i could just keep losing weight im really sold on it
558 if i could describe the new national defense strategy in one word it would be balance
559 for the foreseeable future winning the long war against violent extremist movements will be the central objective of the u s
560 success in iraq and afghanistan is crucial to winning this conflict but it alone will not bring victory
561 we cannot lose sight of the implications of fighting a long term episodic multi front and multidimensional conflict more complex and diverse than the cold war
562 we must display a mastery of irregular warfare comparable to that which we possess in conventional combat
563 the use of force plays a role yet military efforts to capture or kill terrorists are likely to be subordinate to measures to promote local participation in government and economic programs to spur development as well as efforts to understand and address the grievances that often lie at the heart of insurgencies
564 we cant afford to make any mistakes because that would jeopardise the entire production
565 i cant imagine having to work on this project without them kar lai wong and chong
566 we are certainly looking to this match with great hope
567 i am very proud and honoured to have won this award which would not have been possible without the support of my parents azman hassan and rozita ibrahim and my coach lan wei of china
568 im surprised to have won this award as it is my first of this kind but i hope to use this to inspire to win my pet events the uneven bars and balance beam at the asean schools championships
569 my team and i have been working on super tight schedules since the show started there is hardly any room for us to breathe between each episode
570 honestly styling is one of the toughest jobs around but it doesnt discriminate they love you and your work because you make them beautiful inside and out its not all about hanging out with celebrities or anything like that
571 we are working under a lot of constraints and stress i constantly remind my team to keep within the dress code as it would determine the success of the show
572 the backstage normally transforms into a war zone every week we cut snip and even burn some of the costumes to achieve the perfect look for the contestants two weeks ago jimmy had to burn a corset to de stress the lace and mind you the garment looked good after that
573 oh my it was so funny as i had the half ready hat perpetually placed on my head while i continued altering it in front of the mirror at home the whole night
574 the participation of these team from the asia pacific region proves that the universitys aim to go global is producing positive results
575 the winds were medium to strong 12 18 knots and later in the afternoon the waters got rather rough
576 we sailed for about an hour and a half then decided to head in to avoid damaging the mast in a capsize but not before some radical downwind surfing
577 when we got onshore we were advised to lash down our boats as the winds were predicted to get stronger overnight
578 i have not had any problems with my boat but i may have to wait a couple of days since few people will sail with their racing spars in the strong winds predicted for the next two days
579 our plan tomorrow today will be dependent on what the weather looks like and i suspect the gym and pool are going to be popular for most of the day
580 no point trying to be a hero before the battle actually begins
581 we are not happy at all im not sure if muraleedharans job will still be secure after the council meeting as his position as coach will definitely be discussed
582 we have less than a year to prepare the players for the junior world cup
583 if new blood should be injected and coaches be replaced then we will go ahead
584 however we are disappointed with the 102 former internationals for not speaking to us first
585 we would have taken them seriously and considered their proposals
586 however we are not holding any grudges as whats done is done and we must now look ahead
587 we are aware that several parties have received copies of the petition but as for now we are prepared to work with these players regardless what comes next
588 i heard they are interested to contribute through the grassroots and we welcome their ideas
589 i cant comment on the players meeting with sultan azlan shah and mazlan we will just wait and see
590 all reports regarding the coaches and players performance and also documents on the countrys coaching system since 2006 have been given to jegathesan to review
591 what we are doing is collaborating with the mssm the idea is good as teachers will be more involved in coaching and umpiring
592 i would love to race against him but i dont think i would be drawn in the same heat as him
593 the top swimmers will all be grouped into the seeded championship heats and my times wont get me into those heats
594 i said that about the world championships in melbourne last year and i dont think it is going to be any different in beijing
595 it will also be the toughest to make the semis the toughest to make the finals and the toughest to win
596 whether that results in world records all the time or whether the world records will come in the finals i think were going to have to wait and see what happens
597 it wont be a two horse race between australia and the united states i mean you look at countries like britain japan the french the south africans they perform very solidly
598 theyve made changes from going to the semis to the finals to lower medals to gold medals theres a major shift in world swimming
599 i think it is disappointing that someone comes in there and literally steals one of the most exciting moments of the games
600 this is a great surprise and i have not heard of this happening before
601 we are disappointed and frustrated with the broadcast by sbs
602 its no secret that were not satisfied by how the last five races went
603 i was particularly disappointed after the series montreal magny cours silverstone in each one of these races i had the possibility to win but because of one thing or another things didnt go the right way and i lost
604 i never let myself be influenced by tension and i wont start now ive just to keep my focus and continue to give as much as possible race after race thats what ive done every time i was in trouble
605 its still much too early to make any forecasts for the championship considering that the first three drivers are only seven points apart the positions can change in a single race
606 and its useless to cry over spilled milk we are looking ahead with eight races to go and at the end well do the maths we just passed the halfway point of the season so its important to always gain points
607 excluding hockenheim i was always in a position to win and i hope success will come soon
608 the race at hockenheim was the most difficult moment of the season
609 i was really frustrated and disappointed that i couldnt find the right balance of the car but now were in a much better position
610 we had a productive test at jerez especially on the second day the team have done some great work in the development of the f2008 and im confident for hungary
611 i love the circuit and it is a great city budapest so i am looking forward to it very much and i just hope for another good result
612 i wasnt really quite sure i wanted to come and the reason i came is because my kids would kill me if i didnt
613 i was playing so bad that it wasnt even fun
614 i was looking forward to a wonderful day but ive never made as many bogeys as i have the last three months and its driving me crazy
615 what almost killed umno in the last elections is not the leaders but the supporters who leech on them to further their own personal interests
616 if the leadership does not listen to us now i can guarantee we will continue to lose seats in the 13th general election
617 you would be shocked at how many members and leaders did not go out to vote
618 during the general election a supreme council member will ask whether weve eaten whether we are tired whether we are okay now they tell us what resolutions we can and cannot adopt
619 there was this resolution by a branch that wanted all umno ministers wives to wear the tudung
620 that was not passed as the division felt it was not the partys place to force them to do it
621 but every resolution passed or adopted will be in the annual general meeting report
622 if your resolution is not accepted you can still request that it be debated at the division meeting and this request will be put to a vote if you get enough votes from all the divisions at the meeting it will be accepted and debated
623 these days branch members are professionals and they know the partys history and its constitution if i want to be a delegate to the division they will ask me what im about and whom i support for this or that post
624 if i do not answer correctly i will not be chosen and the person who best represents their aspirations will be and that delegate will go to the division and have a hand in forming the partys direction
625 the extremely high subsidies by the us have caused serious damage to cotton farmers in developing countries including those in africa and 150 million in china
626 we believe that the us is not in a position to discuss with developing countries members cotton tariffs until they eliminate their cotton subsidies
627 one of the most reactionary farm bills in the history of the us
628 i come from a country where 300 million people live on us 1 a day and 700 million people live on us 2 a day so it is natural for me and in fact incumbent upon me to see that our agricultural interests are not compromised you dont require rocket science to decide between livelihood security and commercial interests
629 its unfortunate that in a development round we couldnt agree to an issue of livelihood and security
630 looking for commercial interests and enhancing prosperity rather than looking for content which reduces poverty
631 i was living in akita at the time i fitted in almost immediately met numerous great jazz musicians and was blown away by their skills
632 over here the scene is totally different but it is full of promise
633 they come not just to be entertained but also to learn about the music
634 so youd have to know your audience or youd end up disappointing them
635 i wanted to connect with my listeners and before you knew it japan became home to me
636 i paint for a living and not as a hobby
637 i called him at the hotel when dylan answered the phone i was tongue tied i eventually composed myself and told him of my intention
638 he told me to drop it off at the reception and offered complimentary tickets for me and my husband it was awesome
639 im looking forward to this gig because i love performing in acoustic environments where people enjoy music in its purest form
640 unlike other jazz events this one is free plus they get to enjoy food and drink in a very relaxed atmosphere
641 there are 11 sunrise condos near the venue so its within walking distance for residents this explains the good response to the event and why it keeps getting better every year
642 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
643 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
644 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
645 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
646 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
647 liberals it has been said are generous with other peoples money except when it comes to questions of national survival when they prefer to be generous with other peoples freedom and security

661 while it is in some respects a sad day for me i do look forward to the next chapter in my life spending more time with wife wendy my daughters and grandchildren
662 it has been an absolute privilege and honour to serve the wonderful people of this electorate for the past 15 years a responsibility i have never taken for granted
663 there are some real challenges ahead and it will be important that the people of lyne elect someone who has absolute commitment to the job and the capacity to actually deliver the services and government funding this area needs
664 you need the backing of a strong team and i have been privileged to have had that from my federal and state colleagues
665 its also critical to have the absolute support of your family so you can put the people you represent first
666 parliamentary sittings committee work and other duties of a federal member take you away from home for a good six months of the year
667 fortunately i have had the full support of wendy and my daughters who have been prepared to sacrifice family time with me so i could do that job effectively
668 at a recent council meeting representatives from surf lifesaving services australia said 51 people were rescued at the beaches over the past few years
669 how can a council ignore the principles of competitive neutrality and use general revenue to prop up a poorly performing business unit at the expense of an essential service that saves lives
670 tourism in this area will be seriously affected by councils decision to not protect their beaches just so it can maintain market share in an area where there is a viable non council alternative
671 ratepayers should not be punished for councils mismanagement of funds and resources
672 how many more reports findings and data have to be released saying the same thing before governments sit up and listen
673 councils are at financial breaking point and are struggling to provide the services and facilities their ratepayers need and deserve
674 rate pegging is a big problem because it hampers councils ability to set rates according to local needs but a low share of federal taxation revenue skyrocketing election costs and population pressures are also contributing
675 cost shifting is a continuing issue and the state governments recent planning laws are a classic example they mean a bunch of new panels and systems which councils dont support but will have to fund
676 if the government supports iparts recommendation to remove councils exemption from payroll tax and increase our contribution to state run fire services ratepayers will again lose
677 while the infrastructure data used by fiscal star needs to be improved to make the findings for each council more reliable and less alarmist the general conclusions are the same as the independent report into the financial sustainability of local government released in 2006 and various other surveys and findings since
678 the removal of rate pegging and a greater share of federal taxation are part solutions but the state government also needs to stop cost shifting and start supporting local councils and their ratepayers
679 councils are committed to their communities and are good at providing for them but are fighting with one hand tied behind their backs
680 i just wasnt seeing the production and when you get in a situation where you dont see the production and youve got a young group of receivers that are emerging i just felt like it was in our best interests to let him go at this point

703 last year the rough here was almost out of control this year the rough is very average and its part of an experiment theyre doing theyre trying to see if the rough height has any effect on scoring

705 you fall in love with a golf course when you have a setup thats as wonderful as this

710 he george w bush wishes him well and will continue to work closely with him olmert while he remains prime minister
711 its true that olmert was enthusiastic about the peace process and he spoke about this process with great attention but it has not achieved any progress or breakthrough
712 the palestinian authority deals with the prime minister of israel regardless if he is olmert or somebody else
713 i continue to believe wholeheartedly that reaching peace ending terrorism strengthening security and establishing a different relationship with our neighbors are the most vital goals for the future of the state of israel
714 proud to be a citizen of a country in which a prime minister can be investigated like any other citizen
715 was forced to defend himself from ceaseless attacks by the self appointed soldiers of justice who sought to oust him from his position

724 while we were watching the door he calmly walks up to the front with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
725 the guy came to the front of the door with buddys head in his hands decapitated he dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body back up
726 did obama ever use drugs in his days as a community organizer in chicago or when he was a state senator from illinois

728 weve been doing this for 20 years and have data that goes as far back as 1865 and its really abnormal
729 australia is headed for a once in 100 year real estate slump
730 i have never seen the convergence of so many negatives
731 by every metric i can think of australian houses are too expensive
732 new york state and the united states are experiencing a downturn in the economy that is worse than the energy crisis of 30 years ago that is greater than the economic recession of 40 years ago and may yet be as challenging to the american population as even the great depression this crisis is as undeniable as it is dangerous
733 we have to be smarter about money for too long governments have done less with more and paid more for less
734 we are going to have to cut spending the time has come for america to cut up its credit cards
735 there is no quick fix there is no silver bullet there is no painless way in which we can escape these consequences
736 the federal government is going to have to put more into the states that support it in the next few years before we have what will be a national crisis of bankruptcy and perhaps further fiscal insolvency

740 since the start of the year vendors have been wary of the potential decrease in demand for mobile phones
741 that has not stopped vendors from experimenting with and releasing a host of mid range and high end devices with gps touchscreen and multimedia this also goes for hotly contested emerging markets where vendors are introducing phones that offer features in addition to voice telephony reception towards these devices has been warm and as we head into the holiday quarter demand for these and other devices will no doubt increase
742 smartphones are still seeing growth rates hovering around 40 0 year over year while the rest of the industry is growing at roughly 10 0
743 however grouping the rest of the handsets into one category is doing the industry no justice the rise of the feature phone has created a battle at the high end of the market with the main difference between smartphone and feature phone being the high level operating system we expect the competition at the high end will help drive growth within the market and help move volume to higher end devices
744 both the vcfl and the lexton plains football league are delighted with the way the ararat eagles have treated this matter ward said
745 they have been very proactive and have worked hard recently on improving their image both within the league and within the ararat community
746 the stance of the league and the ararat eagles is that we wont tolerate inappropriate behaviour
747 i know what the people of ararat like and they know when im not cooking mrs hevey said
748 ive always wanted to have a go at running my own restaurant mrs hevey said
749 i cant wait its going to be a different sort of experience miss hevey said
750 everyone asked me to stay because they missed my cooking mrs hevey said
751 we are really excited its been a lot of hard work but now its all coming together she said
752 the afl was reluctant to give tom wills the recognition he deserves we started working towards this in november last year but now theyve afl come on board and its really good they have got kevin sheedy to come up here
753 sheedy is such a great ambassador for afl you couldnt get a better person
754 its a wonderful opportunity for all our under 16s reserves and seniors theyre not going to get an opportunity like this again mrs brain said
755 it will be really important for the moyston community there have been signs in the town referring to it being the birthplace of afl since the 1970s she said
756 this will really put a stamp on it that the signs do actually mean something afterall
757 we are going to play in the finals its the celebrations almost overshadowed by that alone mrs brain said
758 this is a great opportunity for moyston to show the rest of australia that little towns really do have a big heart ms kirkpatrick said
759 moyston has a proud footballing history and we really encourage the community to get down to the footy oval to show its support for the game and for the town

766 its got length its got rough its got tough greens so you need to be on your game
767 see what youre dealing with now is karma ha you really are a greek tragedy
768 the comments on your site really made me feel hopeful and better about the whole situation since i have no experience with cardio stuff
769 oh because at st davids we dont do heart transplants
770 well we need to do a heart biopsy and the ones who do that are the doctors who handle transplants
771 but im also not just going in there until you know the risks so in a transplant patient to do a biopsy of the heart to see if theyre rejecting it isnt a big deal but with you phil the risk is five fold and its by no means a simple little procedure if you want i can go in there and biopsy but when i do that the heart can tear and make a hole which well isnt good see the heart is like steak you know how a flank steak can just tear well essentially im going in there and taking bites out of your heart im telling you all of this because you need to know the risks and some people would rather not have the biopsies theyd rather not know whats going on
772 because given all you have atrial fibrillation complete stage three heart block and most concerning in all of this a very low velocity and very erratic heart trace something is wrong and very abnormal something bigger is probably going on now usually you have symptoms you come in complaining about your gallbladder or something and we narrow it down to the heart but everything about this situation is well something weve never seen before
773 if we do the biopsy hopefully well be able to rule out certain heart diseases namely infiltrated cardiomyopothy amyloidosis myocarditis but other things as well the bad thing with doing a biopsy aside from the risks involved with tearing is that sometimes a biopsy yields nothing
774 is you might not like the results i might tell you that you have something that cannot be cured that even a transplant wont fix and some people dont want that kind of knowledge so they elect not to do the biopsy ill let you two talk it over

777 we believe that new media tools redefine who the online newsmakers and reporters are this is part of the foundation upon which nowpublic is built traditional influence lists are increasingly irrelevant because theyre predicated on outdated factors and metrics did we steal a play from an old media pr conceit lists yes do we want more traffic of course but today there are almost innumerable ways for ones voice to be heard the goal of the mostpublic index is to measure on a completely transparent metric driven basis who is most effectively broadcasting their own personal brand online and who are the emerging players

795 my jaw dropped when the doctors told me that 41 percent of the female veterans seen there say they were victims of sexual assault while serving in the military
796 twenty nine percent say they were raped during their military service they spoke of their continued terror feelings of helplessness and downward spirals many of their lives have taken since
797 women serving in the u s military today are more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire in iraq
798 i dont know what youre trying to cover up here but were not going to allow it
799 the defense department appears to be willfully and blatantly advising dr whitley not to comply with a duly authorized congressional subpoena
800 even one sexual assault violates the very essence of what it means to be a soldier and its a betrayal of the armys core values
801 i believe that maria would be alive today if the marines had provided a more effective system to protect the victims of sexual assault
802 the victim should not have the burden to generate evidence for the command
803 maria is dead but there will be many more victims in the future i promise you im here to ask you to do what you can to help change how the military treats victims of crime and to ensure the victims receive the support and protection they need and they deserve
804 occurrences of sexual assault may be exceeding the rates being reported
805 at the 14 installations where gao administered its survey 103 service members indicated that they had been sexually assaulted within the preceding 12 months of these 52 service members indicated that they did not report the sexual assault
806 left unchecked these challenges can discourage or prevent some service members from using the programs when needed

818 o tribunal constitucional pronunciou se pela inconstitucionalidade de v rias normas do decreto que aprovou a revis o do estatuto pol tico administrativo dos a ores nesse sentido irei devolver nos termos da lei o respectivo diploma assembleia da rep blica
819 devo no entanto comunicar aos portugueses que outras normas me suscitam s rias reservas de natureza pol tico institucional
820 trata se acima de tudo da norma relativa dissolu o da assembleia legislativa dos a ores que inovando em rela o ao estatuto em vigor e em rela o ao estatuto da madeira restringe o exerc cio das compet ncias pol ticas do presidente da rep blica pondo em causa o equil brio e a configura o de poderes do nosso sistema pol tico previsto na constitui o
821 em devido tempo alertei v rios dirigentes pol ticos para esta quest o
822 nos termos da constitui o a assembleia legislativa regional pode ser dissolvida pelo presidente da rep blica ouvidos o conselho de estado e os partidos nela representados
823 o diploma em causa pretende agora consagrar o dever adicional de o presidente da rep blica ouvir tamb m a assembleia legislativa os seus grupos e representa es parlamentares e o presidente do governo regional
824 quer isto dizer que o presidente da rep blica estaria sujeito a mais deveres de audi o e consulta no que toca dissolu o da assembleia regional dos a ores do que os previstos para a dissolu o da assembleia da rep blica
825 no caso da assembleia da rep blica o presidente da rep blica nos termos constitucionais n o precisa de ouvir a assembleia da rep blica nem o primeiro ministro mas no caso da assembleia legislativa dos a ores teria de ouvir a pr pria assembleia legislativa regional e o presidente do governo regional
826 a audi o aut noma do presidente do governo regional tanto mais incompreens vel quanto ele tem assento no conselho de estado e a ouvido pelo presidente da rep blica
827 o mesmo se pode dizer relativamente audi o aut noma da assembleia legislativa e dos seus grupos parlamentares porquanto nos termos constitucionais o presidente da rep blica j ouve os partidos nela representados
828 entendo que perigoso para o princ pio fundamental da separa o e interdepend ncia de poderes que alicer a o nosso sistema pol tico aceitar o precedente que poderia ser invocado no futuro de por lei ordin ria como o caso do estatuto pol tico administrativo dos a ores se vir a impor obriga es e limites s compet ncias dos rg os de soberania que n o sejam expressamente autorizados pela constitui o da rep blica
829 semelhante pr tica desfiguraria o equil brio de poderes tal como este tem existido e afectaria o normal funcionamento das institui es da rep blica por isso que considero ser meu dever alertar os portugueses
830 devo igualmente chamar a aten o para um outro ponto conexo com o anterior
831 no passado dia 10 deste m s foi publicada uma lei da assembleia da rep blica sobre o estatuto do representante da rep blica nas regi es aut nomas no qual se estipula tal como consta da constitui o que o representante nomeado e exonerado pelo presidente da rep blica ouvido o governo
832 sobre exactamente o mesmo assunto o decreto da assembleia da rep blica que aprova o novo estatuto dos a ores acrescenta a obriga o do presidente da rep blica ouvir tamb m a assembleia legislativa da regi o
833 n o se questiona a audi o da assembleia regional na pessoa do seu presidente foi isso que fiz no in cio do meu mandato quando nomeei os representantes da rep blica para os a ores e para a madeira pr tica que ali s segui quando desempenhei as fun es de primeiro ministro e que tenciono manter como presidente da rep blica
834 mas se aquela audi o tiver por objecto o pr prio rg o colegial podem emergir consequ ncias negativas no processo de designa o do representante
835 por um lado porque pode colocar o presidente da rep blica no centro de um debate parlamentar regional e por outro porque pode fragilizar politicamente o representante da rep blica e dificultar a escolha de uma personalidade com perfil adequado
836 considero ainda que merecem repondera o outras normas inovadoras constantes do estatuto
837 por um lado o procedimento de audi o qualificada que pelas vincula es que cria para os rg os de soberania envolvidos restringe os seus poderes de decis o ultrapassando em muito a regulamenta o do simples direito de audi o previsto na constitui o
838 por outro lado a limita o dos poderes de revis o do estatuto pela assembleia da rep blica s normas que tenham sido objecto da iniciativa da assembleia legislativa a oriana implica restri es excessivas ao poder de iniciativa legislativa superveniente dos deputados do parlamento nacional
839 face incerteza que caracteriza os tempos modernos a possibilidade de petrifica o de normas jur dicas constantes do estatuto ao ponto de eternizar a sua vig ncia deve ser examinada com todo o cuidado
840 a altera o do estatuto pol tico administrativo dos a ores visa concretizar o modelo avan ado de autonomia resultante da revis o constitucional de 2004 mas indispens vel que essa altera o se harmonize com a separa o de poderes e as compet ncias dos rg os de soberania consagrados na constitui o da rep blica portuguesa
841 temperatures by and large over the summer have been near normal with no real extremes
842 we had kind of a cool may and a warmer april but nothing unusual
843 this year the jet stream has been right over us which is why weve been so stormy
844 because weve been so stormy its kind of kept us out of the heat the forecast for the next two days takes us up into the lower 90s when we get into that warmer weather thats an indication that stream has moved to the north
845 first you can get dehydration which can turn into heat exhaustion and eventually can be heat stroke
846 its a spectrum you go from one to the other
847 you want to drink at a comfortable pace where you dont get sick from drinking and you stay hydrated
848 the mantra this year is celebrate remember and fight back
849 celebrating our survivors remembering those we lost and fighting back against cancer
850 it doesnt matter what race you are what sex you are we all come together to fight cancer we welcome anybody and everybody to come out its a cant miss opportunity
851 i heard i lost so much blood that there was hardly any blood left to bleed
852 it is one of australias iconic brands but the bottom line is that the rsl brand is slowly disappearing and sub branches are losing their homes as they either close or amalgamate
853 a club in bourke has just gone into administration and the areas veteran welfare activities come under threat as you start to lose those threads in those towns
854 in a country town if you lose an rsl club the anzac day activities that occur there disappear in a time where we have seen a resurgence in those activities
855 the way he killed her and chopped up the body shows a terrible cruelty he killed her chopped her up and threw part of her body into the river
856 he started to beat her and she went to live with a friend
857 he is unemployed but he lives well hes always going to parties in the city
858 we can confirm the death of a british national in goiania brazil the body was discovered early on july 29
859 next of kin have been informed and we are providing consular assistance to the family brazilian police are investigating
860 there are around 41 fewer first time buyers now than at the same time last year
861 the nationwide data indicate that there is ongoing major downward pressure on house prices from extremely weak market activity stretched buyer affordability and tight lending conditions it seems odds on that house prices will continue to head rapidly south given that the bank of england reported extremely low mortgage approvals for house purchases in june while latest survey evidence shows that house sales are depressed buyer interest is weak it is taking longer to sell a house and sellers are achieving a falling percentage of their asking price
862 its clear that gordon brown failed to prepare our economy during his 10 years at the treasury and now hard pressed families are paying the price
863 this correction in house prices is happening because the government allowed the market to get hopelessly out of control
864 interest rate cuts are clearly not on the agenda in the near term
865 which would clearly be very bad news for the housing market
866 affected by this regrettable situation in particular to those who had received an inaccurate diagnosis
867 i can confirm that 17 patients were initially informed incorrectly that they did not have a malignancy such as cancer however we must emphasise that a number of these patients would have undergone precautionary treatment anyway or been subject to ongoing clinical review
868 furthermore we can now give absolute assurance that all patients are now following the correct course of treatment
869 our highest priority throughout has been the care and wellbeing of our patients and we have acted as quickly as possible to make sure that the review was carried out thoroughly and effectively
870 the patients involved have generally appreciated the efforts we have made to investigate this situation and to recheck individually their samples diagnosis and treatment and i thank them all for their patience and understanding no patients that we have been able to identify have died as a result of a misdiagnosis
871 where necessary those patients have had their treatment amended we would like to reassure patients that individual details will not be made public
872 clearly everyone affected will be concerned that not having received the appropriate treatment at the appropriate time has adversely affected their chances of recovery or worsened their prognosis
873 this is not the first time that a large group of people have been harmed by what appears to have involved the poor judgment of a histopathologist which is why a careful multi disciplinary approach to diagnosis and assessment of treatment modality is so important
874 an episode such as this demands an independent inquiry into what went wrong so that lessons can be learned across the health service
875 the spiritual leadership of a global communion of independent and autonomous provinces should not be reduced to one man appointed by a secular government
876 unless we reach some kind of resolution in the next 48 hours this whole thing will have been an expensive waste of time
877 the devil may be in the detail of the implementation report to be published in the autumn
878 lack of commitment from nhs management at all levels has impeded progress in implementing informatics support for patient care
879 if we were to criticise it would be that there is little recognition or emphasis on building from experience as a profession we have extensive experience on the issues and problems of health informatics we hope this will be used too much emphasis on central development sometimes ignores this fund of knowledge
880 ticket sales have been brisk and our inventory is dwindling by the day
881 we are ahead of last years sales at this point and are on pace to rival our record for season ticket sales 24 300 in 2001 weve already sold our third most in a year
882 there are matters which have arisen which would have caused anybody very considerable concern
883 the evidence has demonstrated that the practice of beasting which clearly falls outside appropriate military discipline was going on in these barracks openly and must have been known to senior officers
884 many will have found it unpalatable that the order from captain davis to bring this man to them hot and sweaty was an order that the defendants found themselves having to comply with this sort of activity should not be condoned and mustnt be allowed to happen again and this lesson must be clearly relayed to those in charge
885 the conclusion of the trial allows the royal military police now to conduct a full investigation into his death
886 this will examine whether there were any breaches of military law a decision can then be made on further action i am unable to comment until this investigation concludes
887 left no stone unturned in their effort to establish the full circumstances
888 we are devastated with the outcome of the verdicts today we have come this far we owe it to gavin that nobody elses child goes through what happened to gavin
889 we have all been hung out to dry its been really stressful i feel great sympathy for gavin williams family beasting is happening all the time the army should address it
890 this government has reached an end national responsibility requires a return to the people and new elections
891 the most failed and corrupt leader in the history of israel
892 british gas customers still reeling from 35 price hikes might have expected centrica to be losing money
893 they will be staggered at the rude health of centricas half year profit
894 customers will be outraged to learn that while they ponder how to make ends meet centricas shareholders are enjoying an increase in their dividends
895 across the uk fuel poverty could affect 6 million households by the end of the year
896 ministers may well be on holiday now but they need to stop their sunbathing and plan ahead to protect vulnerable households from the cold this winter
897 this combination of massive profits and eye watering price rises proves that the privatised provision of basic utilities has failed the public
898 they should be taken back into some form of ownership by the community
899 these latest vast profits now put the case for a windfall tax on big oil companies beyond argument
900 the government should grasp the nettle and do what it did in 1997 by taxing grotesque profits and put the proceeds into helping the millions of people struggling with their fuel bills
901 i dont see why it will help consumers in the long term
902 after external investment in frostfrench in 2006 in which they had to relinquish their overall control and influence in the company a new management team was installed sadie and jemima have been unhappy with the strategic direction and many of the day to day decisions
903 has ensured the future of the brand and has preserved jobs
904 i dont want to go into too much detail but it will be a completely new approach
905 sadie and jemima relish the opportunity to be fully hands on again both designers are working on their next collection
906 the club has sought clarification from the fa as to why this decision has been reached now given the incident occurred nearly 15 months ago
907 as we said yesterday we agree with david that the whole party should pull together take the fight to the tories and focus on dealing with the real issues affecting peoples lives
908 what has mr miliband ever achieved apart from furthering his own career if david miliband was placed back on the backbenches then i think he would become the nonentity that he was before his accelerated promotion
909 duplicitous it says one thing but it means another which is pretty contemptible politics
910 i think the worst thing at the moment would be if we all went mute i think its right that we say that sure weve taken some hits but actually weve got ideas about the future of the country we do want to engage with people were not all standing at the side of the ring saying go on gordon you do it on your own were saying were there with you were going to get in there and make sure that this really is a team effort because we have to take collective responsibility for this
911 the analysis of the teeth suggests the men grew up in a warm climate probably somewhere in southern europe professor montgomery said
912 its also known that at this time henry viii was short of skilled soldiers and sailors and was trying to recruit mercenaries from the continent
913 a key driver of marketing budgets is corporate profitability and when corporate profits are hurting marketing gets hit
914 weve never subscribed to is it structural or is it cyclical
915 we believe obviously that media is fragmenting but if you can build your portfolio by launch and acquisition and the right combination of products to meet the needs of readers and advertisers theres no reason you cant grow very healthily in the future
916 we have to plan and manage our business on the assumption that this difficult environment will continue for some time to come advertising is inextricably linked to the economy and the economy is still deteriorating
917 i could buy market share tomorrow pick a number and i could buy it but it would mean cutting the price like our competitors to inflate sales volume and spending cash on dvds and cds just to make a headline sales increase from which shareholders will not get a return
918 we look back on the multiples we sold the businesses on and they look like damn good multiples now dont they
919 we have no plans to do that and no issues with our balance sheet
920 i want to continue to do this job as long as my board and my shareholders want me to
921 when he hit top gear at the two furlong marker he picked up the leader in a matter of strides he is better than any stayer ive ridden in that he just has that bit of class he equalled sagaros record of three gold cup wins at ascot and i know theres lots of people who come to the races just to see him
922 shes not the easiest filly in the world but shes run here three times and won twice and finished second in this last year so she obviously likes the place
923 i dont really know where shell go next id expect her to go to stud next year as shes done her stuff
924 she will go next to the park hill stakes at doncaster and i think she could be a 10lb better filly next year
925 what is quite clear is that lucas is determined to stop mr ainsworth by whatever legitimate legal means are open to it including the threat of a 10m judgment hanging over him
926 makes it clear that lucasfilm and george lucas are the rightful owners of the copyrights related to star wars we do not intend to use this ruling to discourage our fans from expressing their imagination creativity and passion for star wars through the costumes and props they make for their personal use rather we see the courts decision as reaffirming that those who seek to illegally profit from star wars will be brought to task
927 youve been out there all day running in and then the decision gets turned down you can chunter as much as you want at the umpire but youve got to get on with it it was an aimless rant i went in to see aleem afterwards and apologised i shook his hand and were friends again
928 we needed to get wickets to get into the game it was nice to take some ive worked hard to get to this point after everything ive done with my physio dave roberts over the past six months after my ankle operation im pleased
929 when youre coming up against some of the best players in the world and kallis is right up there it brings the best out of you
930 its nice to get 200 but id sooner have done it 15 or 20 tests ago
931 i would withdraw from public life and make certain gestures and in return the us would fulfil its commitments
932 my commitment was to withdraw and not to endanger in any way the implementation of the dayton agreement to withdraw even from literary life
933 i believe that its very important for my fate for my legal position
934 i have to show why im appearing before this court only now not in 1996 or 97 or 98 when i had the intention of appearing here my life was in danger of being liquidated because i had made a deal
935 if mr holbrooke still wants my death and regrets that there is no death sentence in this court i wonder if his arm is long enough to reach me here
936 i have an invisible adviser but i have decided to represent myself
937 self representation is indeed a right but if mr karadzic uses that to obstruct trial proceedings as mr milosevic did then the court should step in and take action
938 speed matters in a showdown between gunslingers but it has no place in court
939 scenes from hell written on the darkest pages of history
940 i have not found one bone of my children yet and there he is alive
941 today i feel there is a bit of justice in this otherwise really pitiful world
942 if the dating remains as inconclusive a homicide inquiry is unlikely
943 i believe that it is very likely that children died here what i cannot say is how they died
944 we are highly suspicious of the circumstances of how we found bones and the teeth burnt and buried
945 the abuse aspect was quite appalling enough without children dying
946 my estimate is that at least 500 million of those medicines are wasted
947 our pharmacists have reported many instances when patients have been confused by their medicines
948 we know that many patients choose not to complete their course of medication
949 but this study reveals a different type of problem patients who for whatever reason take their medicines incorrectly the biggest issues are among those who are taking more than one prescription medicine at a time the problem seems to be more acute among older patients
950 hes a dog he told me i was his girlfriend and then my friend went to the opening of surf lodge and was introduced to another woman he called his girlfriend there are girls all over with him

956 you have got to be kidding you know i cannot answer that question first of all i am a lawyer and would have to protect any information about whom i am acting for or even if i am acting for a particular person but more importantly i believe in freedom of the blog it is a variation of freedom of the press and i have no intention of revealing any sources or giving out any confidential information
957 thanks to you i have just won a big bottle of canadian club i bet with my colleagues that you would say that our bet was a bottle of rye whiskey as you know one is either a rye man or a scotch man as for me unless i put in some mix to kill the taste i would never drink scotch
958 please blogmeister we think you are the only one who can help us we have read your blogs you are the only one in windsor and essex county who seems to understands the windsor star and its main columnist gord henderson in particular
959 you did not need to go to all of this drama for that you could have just waited a few hours until my next blog came out
960 we know that you spent five years working on one of the worlds largest private white collar bankruptcies two years of it in london england we know that you managed a hundred or more professionals around the world working under you and that you helped coordinate a worldwide seizure by various police forces of documents on the same day and at the same time it was unprecedented hendersons fixation on scotch whiskey and malt whiskey specifically intrigued us because one of the claims to fame of the hotel that you stayed at in london was its world famous scotch malt bar we assumed that he was signalling you since he would have thought that only you two knew that

970 there are good reasons why the original native american tribes settled in this area why the explorers came why people settled here and built their cities and why the area continues to provide a very high quality of life and economic well being for millions of people
971 the thing thats a bit more challenging is the portion near caron and the old railway cut because that will require a lot of excavation to bring the river water in
972 also included in brooks concept is conversion of a three block stretch of either pitt street or chatham street into a new east west 20 foot deep canal filled with municipal not detroit river water that eventually travels north back toward the riverfront on property just west of the art gallery
973 calvin brook the award winning toronto urban designer who conceived this plan
974 i tend to assume he has his ducks already lined up
975 mpp sandra pupatello l windsor west who spoke to francis about the plan a few months ago

1010 you are loved you are cared for you are beautiful never for this
1011 i havent made up my mind whether to go through with it
1012 this is the perfect storm for our business and we see no signs of it blowing over
1013 overall results were weaker than expected due to one time charges and asset sale writeoffs in both rescap and gmac auto
1014 we expect weak results in both businesses to continue at least through the end 2008
1015 we spend the money and the tons dont come out
1016 weve seen that come on track in the latter part of the second quarter but not enough to affect it
1017 the lawn and garden category has proven to be resilient in a difficult economic environment and we are pleased with the results we announced today
1018 prospex achieved significant production growth during the second quarter as a result of a successful winter drilling program
1019 our summer drilling program is now underway in west central alberta with drilling operations in the deep basin scheduled to start within the next week
1020 its a category we believe in and we see an opportunity to grow it even faster as a pure play leader in its business
1021 we think its a business that has great potential and a great future
1022 the microsoft negotiations were just the latest example of the negligence by this board
1023 there is still a lot of anger and frustration among shareholders right now
1024 we believe the board is independent and focused on value creation for long term shareholders
1025 our results reflect continuing input cost pressures that have more than offset the improvements we have been able to achieve in realized selling prices for our products
1026 we have continued to focus on improving our operations which has resulted in improved operating efficiency reduced consumption of high cost fuel sources higher throughput in our pulp and paper operations and reduced fixed costs
1027 the significant increase in second quarter earnings and cash flow demonstrates transcanadas ability to deliver strong financial performance from its growing portfolio of high quality assets
1028 this is the perfect storm for our business and we see no signs of it blowing over
1029 overall results were weaker than expected due to one time charges and asset sale writeoffs in both rescap and gmac auto
1030 we expect weak results in both businesses to continue at least through the end 2008
1031 some of these measures require additional work but the agency will come back to these and others each year
1032 we are working hard to improve quality and efficiency but simply not paying for complications or conditions that while regrettable are not entirely preventable is not the way to do it

1036 the reverence the raptness the depth of concentration in his bravely deep poems
1037 the dazzling conquest of mexico gave a new impulse to the ardor of discovery
1038 the hardest part in the repatriation process is getting the museum to agree with you and cranbrook has already done that
1039 we feel it is the right thing to do we dont need the law to tell us that
1040 we are a museum and institute which feels very strongly about cultural rights heritage and history of native americans on a global scale we view remains as people not research objects
1041 its impossible to ascertain who these remains belong to but they have been determined to be native american they are from michigan and based on those facts alone we believe they are affiliated with anishnaabek
1042 it could be from all of the bands or one of them we believe our best line of evidence is we were here a substantial amount of time before european contact
1043 i feel really confident the review board will give us the recommendation and that this will be a success
1044 once the case is in our favor its a formality where the remains are buried
1045 i totally see why people follow convention people dont want other people to be different and they dont want them to be happy when theyre different because then the implication is that they could live differently too a lot of people just cant face that
1046 in germany they first came for the gypsies and i didnt speak up because i wasnt a gypsy then they came for the bolsheviks and i didnt speak up because i wasnt a bolshevik then they came for the jews and i didnt speak up because i wasnt a jew then they came for the trade unionists and i didnt speak up because i wasnt a trade unionist then they came for the catholics i didnt speak up then because i was a protestant then they came for me and there was no one left to speak up
1047 it promises to be the best stage of the race
1048 i think its the best thing to happen to santa cruz
1049 i dont think people really know how monumental this is in terms of exposure especially internationally
1050 certainly its nice to go where people appreciate cycling that would clearly be santa cruz and davis those two cities we heard all along in those two cycling is as popular as anywhere in the state which transfers to anywhere in the country really
1051 we are really especially given our budget going to be focused on finding support
1052 the great thing was it brought a lot of people into the downtown core restaurants coffee shots and stores all did really well
1053 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
1054 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
1055 were excited because surprises are where discoveries come from one surprise is how the soil is behaving the ice rich layers stick to the scoop when poised in the sun above the deck different from what we expected from all the mars simulation testing weve done that has presented challenges for delivering samples but were finding ways to work with it and were gathering lots of information to help us understand this soil
1056 its a 30 watt light bulb giving us a laser show on mars
1057 the details and patterns we see in the ground show an ice dominated terrain as far as the eye can see
1058 they help us plan measurements were making within reach of the robotic arm and interpret those measurements on a wider scale
1059 ive an idea if we block off the sitting room end of the chimney i could run a tube from the exhaust of the car down from the chimney pot carbon monoxide the end would be quick and he wouldnt suffer any more

1066 as these foreign powers grow in wealth and influence the danger is that a country which is as open as britain to foreign investment eventually just becomes the kind of plaything for the political whims of foreign powers
1067 dubai buying liverpool may not be much of an issue but when it comes to a utility or a major bank it could well be
1068 i think theyve proven themselves to be a stabilizing influence in the world
1069 theyve put to work billions of dollars to stabilise the banking system in europe and specifically in the us
1070 theyre frequently run either directly by government officials or by government cronies so although we have not yet seen any cases of outright abuse its quite possible that well get them and in fact i think it is extremely likely over the next five to 10 years
1071 if we come to the crunch about issues like taiwan tibet things where we are strategic competitors in a way and we dont agree does that mean we are going to be very muted in our response that were going to be obliged to react less strongly than we did before
1072 they are going to be very big players and that shouldnt worry us
1073 would we prefer the countries of the gulf to be earning all that money and burying it in the sand would we prefer the chinese to be simply hoarding the money or bailing out our banks and investing it in potentially profitable investment opportunities in the uk or germany or france or america
1074 by 2012 sovereign wealth funds will have about 7 trillion to invest worldwide

1076 as a christian as a biblical christian i have real concerns about this because i dont find this in the scriptures
1077 you see its true the world has all kinds of problems but hes working on the symptoms and avoiding the root cause which is the sin nature of humanity so how can you work with all kinds of people who are called people of faith but its not biblical faith
1078 these are the stories that we live for at nbc news across all our platforms we are offering an unprecedented amount of convention coverage and we stand ready to field an incredibly talented and deeply knowledgeable team

1082 lo que descubrimos es que esta enfermedad es un defecto de la capacidad defensiva m s primaria que tiene el ser humano para responder a una infecci n
1083 de estos tres ni os dos han fallecido lo cual indica la gravedad de esta enfermedad
1084 y de los nueve casos que se conocen agrega el m dico cinco fueron descubiertos en espa a
1085 para que el organismo pueda llegar a una respuesta inflamatoria explica el doctor rodrigo alguien le tiene que avisar al sistema inmune para que lance su defensa
1086 pero en estos ni os falla una de las mol culas encargadas de avisar al sistema inmune de la presencia de una infecci n y de que debe responder a ella
1087 lo que nos sorprendi encontrar fue que a diferencia de los ni os los animales resultaron susceptibles a infecciones de todo tipo de virus bacterias etc
1088 pero el ser humano al parecer s lo es susceptible al estafilococo y neumococo cuando falla este gen as que ahora estamos tratando de descubrir porqu ocurre esto
1089 por eso ahora que conocemos esta enfermedad esperamos que m s m dicos alrededor del mundo puedan reconocer esta alteraci n cuando algo falle en el organismo y no se logre identificar qu es

1100 we have to remember that the model is not the disease
1101 if you want to maintain a constant level of inhibition with more neurosteroids you need fewer receptors
1102 after pregnancy when hormone levels drop off you need more receptors to maintain that level if you cannot maintain that level after pregnancy thats when the disorders manifest
1103 our thinking is that postpartum depression and maybe premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder may be due to impaired trafficking of these gaba receptors to the neural membrane
1104 we dont know if this is the same mechanism in humans but i think all indications are there
1105 the women that are affected by the disorder the hormone levels are not changed they are not different than in unaffected women so we are confident that it must be the receptor trafficking mechanism that is affected because the changes in hormone levels are pretty normal

1121 there have been at least three marine biodiversity hotspots during the past 50 million years
1122 they have moved across almost half the globe with their timing and locations coinciding with major tectonic events
1123 its clearly something we cant do anything about but the hotspot is more vulnerable than it used to be 6 or 10 million years ago
1124 its more vulnerable so you have to be extra cautious about what you do its closer to the edge than it was
1125 everybody sees china as this monster polluter but it is doing so much more than that
1126 china is already leading in certain types of technologies in the power sector it is in clean coal solar wind in transport it is developing more efficient compact cars and electric cars
1127 developed countries really need to demonstrate their sincerity demonstrate the feasibility of the solutions really demonstrate that they are serious about this
1128 telling developing countries that they must do it when they themselves are not is just not acceptable
1129 in china the top leadership are all of the same mindset china opened up 30 years ago but our economic miracle was driven by intense resource use that produced great pollution and recently unrest
1130 that is fully understood the leadership has been thinking about a new pathway they know they cant repeat the path of the past they know it has to be clean it has to be more efficient low carbon has now been integrated into this new pathway
1131 china has got the green message companies are making profits in pushing forward the low carbon economy
1132 the thinking in china is that there is no doubt that in 20 or 30 years time china will be a world leader
1133 if you can only have energy when the sun is shining youre in deep trouble and thats why in my opinion photovoltaics havent penetrated the market
1134 if i could provide a storage mechanism then i make energy 24 7 and then we can start talking about solar
1135 i can turn sunlight into a chemical fuel now i can use photovoltaics at night
1136 opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
1137 on the oxygen side it doesnt work well and you have to put way more energy in than needed to get the oxygen out

1142 this is not expected to have a negative impact on kyoto implementation

1188 a person who poses no danger to the community will be able to remain in the community while their visa status is resolved
1189 labor rejects the notion that dehumanising and punishing unauthorised arrivals with long term detention is an effective or civilised response
1190 desperate people are not deterred by the threat of harsh detention they are often fleeing much worse circumstances
1191 so many people who have already come through that asylum seeker process having spent time in places like woomera and baxter have been damaged for life and they have huge problems in terms of integrating in the community and becoming citizens as a result of the experiences they have endured
1192 this government must ensure that no change of heart or government can turn this policy around

1281 of course i am keep your guard up mine will be
1282 id be buying lobsters anyway but not as many if the prices werent this low
1283 the one bit of information that someone was able to tuck into their pocket and go back to their own pc at home or go to the library or whatever they did and utilize that that made them remember they talked to one of our firefighters
1284 we put the butts in the seat but now we have to hope that they passed and that everything worked
1285 i did have some calls from some suburbs of chicago
1286 i talked several times with evanston fire department sent them our information on what were doing with facebook and myspace and so on and then shared with them how things work
1287 jamars decision to violate the terms of our personal agreement for his potential return to our basketball program has left me with no other recourse but to rescind that opportunity
1288 at this time jamar and his family need to focus their attention on the issues that have brought jamar to this point for the good of our program and players we need to move forward and prepare for the 2008 09 season
1289 while jamar will always be a part of the illinois basketball family i have made the decision that he can no longer be a part of our team our entire team and coaching staff are obviously very disappointed he will not be with us we will continue to do everything we can to help him continue his academic career and achieve his goal of graduation
1290 he wants to give both the packers and brett an appropriate amount of time to make decisions including decisions impacting the teams roster and salary cap when brett is reinstated by the commissioner we will announce it
1291 i really dont have any thoughts as far as mark murphy going to mississippi
1292 thats something youre going to have to ask mark about im not involved in the specifics of it i really have no information for you
1293 the system level aspect of cloud computing is thus far inadequately understood so thats where we see our niche
1294 oh man that was the heaviest slam weve ever seen
1295 i didnt believe much of your testimony and i didnt believe much of your testimony because of your claimed lack of memory
1296 you hear over and over against that all government officials are corrupt
1297 michelle obama connects to the modern woman she has a real woman look to her but is even bigger and better
1298 she has a sleek style thats not overdone shes beautifully dressed without too much fuss she puts on the dress and goes and its always a good dress
1299 the alaia shows shes a little bit of a fashion insider but its more of her intelligence and independence that shows through
1300 we consider ourselves the electoral college that oversees the popular vote
1301 you have a sense of her as a physical person on the move and on the go not a paper doll cutout
1302 i am excited to be joining the chicago fire for many reasons one of the most important of those is chicago is my hometown
1303 his tremendous skill and dedication to the sport are an inspiration to us all were thrilled we are able to bring him back to chicago and mls and i am confident he will have an important impact on the team
1304 gay lesbian bisexual and transgender individuals enjoy an atmosphere of inclusion and respect
1305 for a fraudulent substitution of urine which is both a prohibited method and also a form of tampering with the doping control process
1306 these rule violations were established following the deliberate storage of samples by the iaaf and reanalysis using comparative dna techniques and were the result of a specific investigation which was instigated and carried out by the iaaf for more than a year

1310 i want to see a demolition crew come out here
1311 i want to see the fire department do a test burn i want to see it gone
1312 hes been on the lam for four years and we were initially told he fled to china

1315 si bien la familia no guarda un parentesco directo de sangre si
1316 dijo c rdenas quien record que familiares de las v ctimas y varias de ellas vivieron muchos a os en un rancho de su familia
1317 la casa donde ocurrieron los hechos fue de mi propiedad hasta hace dos meses y medio
1318 did not accomplish their duty correctly and they tried to influence the votes
1319 very concerned by this loss of the right to vote
1320 brings in a loss of confidence by the public in the election process
1321 i dont know how the mayor can come in with less than 30 days experience as a public official and start getting rid of employees
1322 it would just be my assumption that she feels it involves staff it was clear she meant shults but i think it involved staff too
1323 think about the words users would type to find your pages and make sure that your site actually includes those words within it
1324 i now realise that art for arts sake was actually a cry for help from oscar wilde and his friends against the reality which is art for moneys sake
1325 it may be a long time before we see prices as good as these again but it may just be that we are at the start of a boom which could last as long as the one in the 19th century mainly 32 years between 1863 and 1895
1326 photography i think as far as other media are concerned is still undervalued in general primarily because it can only be as old as the invention of the camera
1327 in the early 1990s records were being set at 10 000 to 15 000 now records are being set at 2 5m or 3m for a photograph
1328 our average loan size is 5m so we arent going to have thousands of clients
1329 we deal with everybody but we dont make loans below 250 000 simply because were just not geared to that level of business
1330 that being said we would have to have a minimum value of 500 000 of collateral that we were lending on
1331 that still leaves plenty of collectors out there but we dont tend to do the smaller entry level type works
1332 no collector buys in a void nothing happens in the way of collecting without information information is at the core of it
1333 you cant be a collector by just looking around and picking things
1334 the last thing you want to do is to get somebody to buy something through your own passion and your own directive that theyre not engaged with because the process ends at that moment because then it just becomes get me a damien hirst get me a warhol and that isnt collecting
1335 in 20 years time i believe that the most expensive prices surfacing on the art market will be coming out of china and russia and india probably for artists none of us has heard of in the west and possibly for pictures that have not yet been painted
1336 is a one day event held twice a year in washington dc if youre an actor think of it as a mass audition youll be able to perform a monologue in front of 20 or more production companies looking to produce films in the next six months if youre a filmmaker think of stonehenge as a mass casting tool showing you over 100 actors whom you might call back to read for a specific part
1337 microsoft continues to state that vba will be included in office for many many more versions
1338 microsoft visual basic 6 4 version 1001 vba retail 6 5 1001 form3 12 0 3417 just as it does in excel 2000 score 1 for abandonware there
1339 the state was stepping in to replace the punitive poor law there had been before
1340 it did provide for more people but it didnt provide enough to live on and it was a very stringent means test
1341 for the first time many people were living beyond the point when they were physically capable of working
1342 it was the very first universal cash benefit without the stigma of the poor law
1343 despite the years of argument about national insurance and the importance of contributions it had no contribution condition
1344 that in turn meant that help could reach pensioners straight away
1345 it will have to last because a large number of people will never be able to save enough to live on in their old age
1346 under the rubric of the global war on terror the bush administration has implemented the greatest realignment of us forces since the end of the cold war
1347 the impact in africa will likely be the same as in iraq perpetual occupation instability and growing anti americanism
1348 africa is an area of increasing activity for both big oil and the us military
1349 a key mission for us forces in africa would be to insure that nigerias oilfields which in the future could account for as much as 25 of all us oil imports are secure
1350 a much quieter us military build up is underway on another continent
1351 the key aspect of which is the us militarys transformation into a global oil protection force
1352 us companies hope to expand their operations further in africa
1353 spend half the time going down the west coast to africa
1354 of course its about oil we cant really deny that
1355 of course its about oil we cant really deny that
1356 their health coverage is terminated and with little or no family support many of them end up homeless unemployed or in jail
1357 they have the same hopes and dreams as all other children in america but they have a harder path to realizing their dreams
1358 it encourages employers to look twice at these remarkable young people
1359 the services will still be here but in a different structure
1360 we have been downsizing for a while this used to be a six person office
1361 we are a charity and we depend on the people
1362 we will continue to serve the county when disasters like this hit
1363 the facts of this case to me are quite clear he knew what he was doing he intended to kill a human being and he knew that it was wrong
1364 i believe that benjamin was truly insane at the commission of the offense
1365 we wanted something more from the defense and the witnesses and we didnt get a lot
1366 he has no feelings or emotion about what he did
1367 obama has gotten away with making a 180 degree turn because he is now the only democratic game in town
1368 to be clear barack will support a filibuster of any bill that includes retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies
1369 obama has gotten away with making a 180 degree turn
1370 obama claims he will work to remove the provision granting immunity to law breakers but the fact remains that obama has gotten away with making a 180 degree turn because he is now the only democratic game in town
1371 thats the best thing that happened to me people are angry about this heres a man who has not served his district and obama is messing in our local business
1372 black folks are all too happy to go along with any treatment that obama chooses to mete out
1373 if obama were already president dissidents would have cause to shop for a safehouse or foreign getaway
1374 the treachery didnt stop with illegal government surveillance regina thomas is a black state senator in georgia running in a democratic primary against white conservative congressman john barrow obama recently endorsed barrow and recorded a radio ad in support of his campaign
1375 spook that sat by the oval office door and slyly make everything alright for them once he gets in
1376 millions of people have deliberately made their needs subservient to those of a politician who cares nothing about them the damage done by jim crow americas apartheid is never ending the desire to see a black face in a high place is an understandable one after so many decades of exclusion but it is still dangerous to accept this misguided concept
1377 theres only one thing different about barack obama when it comes to being a democratic presidential candidate hes half african american
1378 whether that will make any difference i dont know i havent heard him have a strong crackdown on economic exploitation in the ghettos payday loans predatory lending asbestos lead whats keeping him from doing that is it because he wants to talk white he doesnt want to appear like jesse jackson well see all that play out in the next few months and if he gets elected afterwards
1379 i mean first of all the number one thing that a black american politician aspiring to the presidency should be is to candidly describe the plight of the poor especially in the inner cities and the rural areas and have a very detailed platform about how the poor is going to be defended by the law is going to be protected by the law and is going to be liberated by the law
1380 he wants to show that he is not a threatening another politically threatening african american politician
1381 he wants to appeal to white guilt you appeal to white guilt not by coming on as black is beautiful black is powerful basically hes coming on as someone who is not going to threaten the white power structure whether its corporate or whether its simply oligarchic and they love it whites just eat it up
1382 a flip flop of epic proportions noting that obama s argument about a gop financial advantage was
1383 osborne and others suggested the endorsement was a reward for barrow throwing his superdelegate vote to obama thomas did not back obama until around the time he locked up the nomination
1384 how hard is it for you to understand that obama is not black he is half black he owes no allegiance to the black community and in the business of politics i better damn well not see any alliances not related to philosophy and principles
1385 wait until he get in and then well hold him accountable
1386 basically hes coming on as someone who is not going to threaten the white power structure whether its corporate or whether its simply oligarchic and they love it whites just eat it up
1387 republicans for obama is a grassroots organization of proud party members who all share one important trait
1388 its not the potus job to lead the black liberation movement
1389 revise history was what i said not true were the leaders of movement politicians or were they regular people
1390 werent you supporting obama it seems that you have revised your previous position
1391 you have to acknowledge that the idea that all africans should have been unified is wrong because africa is a diverse continent with many cultures and differences why would they have banded together
1392 i dont care if you are poor you can still send my campaign 5 or 10 dollars
1393 famous for streamlining ge reducing management from 29 levels to only six closing businesses and firing a significant percentage of his subordinates
1394 henry ford challenged his times and his investors by insisting on producing affordable automobiles for a mass market
1395 paris hilton has made millions of dollars by doing things that are supposed to get famous people into trouble
1396 the american public willingly made all sorts of sacrifices in their personal and family lives and it was not that way during vietnam
1397 naturally the common people dont want war but after all it is the leaders of a country who determine the policy and its always a simple matter to drag people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders this is easy all you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and for exposing the country to danger it works the same in every country
1398 why of course the people dont want war why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor for that matter in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same way in any country
1399 they would never stage 9 11 the people who hold positions of power in our govt have hearts made of gold
1400 big plane hit a big building and left a big hole
1401 sometimes i change events dates and places in a certain way to protect people i cant fudge what i write but i can certainly fudge what i say

1404 6 customer support in india is the best thing that has ever happened to norton symantec they take 1 million calls a month prior to outsourcing the most calls per month was less than 100k you may hate the accent but they do great work
1405 dont even get me started on 360 and their supposed
1406 if youve got a ps3 you should get these games
1407 picking between the ps3 and 360 versions of rock band is pretty much a toss up
1408 here are the 24 titles that every playstation 3 owner should have in their collection
1409 more developers are inclined to produce more exclusive dlc gta4 in exchange for a bigger share of the profits

1416 i am among the eldest of generation x on the cusp of the boomers i tend to identify with the gen x characteristics especially survivalism pragmatism and realism
1417 its not important to get it right the rst time its important to get it right the last time
1418 painting animals and wildlife has been my passion since childhood
1419 their faces captivate me especially the inquisitive expressions and soft eyes of cows and dogs and the majestic independence of moose and big cats
1420 you measure the size of the accomplishment by the obstacles you had to overcome to reach your goals
1421 calibrated to cause the best kind of trouble the trouble that forces us to ask how we can make the world a better place
1422 size and strength have more to do with dna than with leadership manuals
1423 decisions are complex and there are always competing factors to look for simple explanations is the bias of the human brain but it doesnt correspond to reality nothing is ever as straightforward as it appears
1424 in the history of africa there have been only a handful of democratically elected leaders who willingly stood down from office mandela was determined to set a precedent for all who followed him not only in south africa but across the rest of the continent he knows that leaders lead as much by what they choose not to do as what they do
1425 hace falta un poco m s de conciencia por parte de los conductores quienes deben entender que por las v as donde se hace el embudo y se reduce a un s lo canal el transporte p blico no debe descargar o cargar pasajeros
1426 si se avanza en estos trabajos hay menos colapso incluso estudiamos la posibilidad de instalar una peque a f brica de cemento en la fuerzas armadas para facilitar el trabajo
1427 esperemos que el tsj empiece a rectificar lo que ha sido una violaci n de los derechos humanos
1428 para lograr tales acuerdos tuvimos que solicitar ante la instancia mayor ministerio de educaci n la aprobaci n de 40 mediante dos cr ditos adicionales todo ello en vista de que el c lculo asignado por el ente oficial a la avec seg n subvenci n fue de un total de bsf 570
1429 los cr ditos adicionales suman bsf 282 762 los cuales distribuiremos en dos partes una de ellas estar depositada dios mediante para este viernes
1430 hasta la fecha tenemos un total de 202 expedientes en el ministerio de educaci n todos ellos con 25 a os de servicio y m s
1431 la capacidad est agotada las calles son insuficientes y no se est n desarrollando rutas alternas
1432 ha crecido el transporte automotor y no hay ninguna v a nueva
1433 por hora pasan menos carros y no se aprovecha la autopista en su m xima capacidad
1434 estaban bien concebidas para sus pocas tan bien las hicieron que todav a funcionan manejan el tr fico deficientemente pero lo manejan
1435 no hay planificaci n ni inter s en hacer nuevas v as
1436 se est n haciendo unas trancas horribles la gente se demora tres y hasta cuatro horas para salir de caracas por la valle coche lo mismo pasa por parque del este y en la autopista prados del este eso y que es horrible
1437 esas nuevas v as se llenar an de carros r pidamente lo mejor es fomentar el transporte p blico y que las rutas nuevas no sean alimentadoras sino complementarias
1438 las v as nuevas van a generar m s congesti n hacen falta soluciones r pidas el problema del tr fico se puede resolver con peque os detalles pero efectivos si todos unidos pudi ramos coordinarnos ver amos mejoras a corto plazo
1439 el 35 de los conductores no deber a atravesar la capital

1441 no se puede salir de la rinconada hacia maracay sin regresar hasta fuerte tiuna dar la vuelta y tomar la autopista regional del centro lo mismo sucede para los que quieren llegar a la rinconada por esta autopista son dos enlaces viales necesarios que no se hicieron
1442 las cooperativas son un instrumento del mismo capitalismo y deber amos inclusive discutir los modelos porque ustedes sin darse cuenta pudieran esta reproduciendo el modelo que queremos desplazar

1448 i think its irresponsible of the oil companies to be making such large profits
1449 they say what they need to say to get into office unfortunately
1450 i remember in high school gas was 92 cents per gallon
1451 to look at the amount were paying for gas at the pump and see these record profits in the oil companies its not like theyre just passing on their costs to the consumer theyre really getting a lot of profit out of this
1452 weve got a group of blokes there that are very excited about whats ahead of them and looking to make the most of it
1453 to win a tri nations match it doesnt matter where it is its significant and weve got one coming up and were looking forward to it

1455 may be effective in relieving symptoms of acute bronchitis in adults and children
1456 may also be effective in alleviating symptoms of acute rhinosinusitis and the common cold in adults
1457 there is encouraging evidence from currently available data that p sidoides is effective compared to placebo for patients with acute bronchitis
1458 this is not a complex case it should be one that moves quickly
1459 i understand why the senator would like to have this matter commenced and concluded before the elections and by all indications that is possible
1460 but ive never had a situation with a general election coming 98 days after an indictment
1461 hey dad ran over a bike uh my gas is leaking gnight bye
1462 that is when most problems occur when people go to the newer versions youll always hear when a new one comes out its got some bugs in it still that is just because there are so many kinds of computers they couldnt possibly test everything even though they try
1463 i see that every day the only thing any warranty is going to cover is hardware related basically the manufacturer warranty will cover hardware but not software
1464 software support is a lot more time consuming than your standard tech support a lot of it is user error you almost have to try to train the person how to use the software in order to make everything work the way it is supposed to
1465 you can google your problem and end up with all kinds of resources but it is going to be mixed in with useless information and people trying to charge you stuff
1466 a lot of this really does come back to computer literacy
1467 they cut down on printing these big volumes of manuals that never were used we have a saying that probably less than 10 percent of people ever cracked their manual especially if everything is going right you dont look for it until something goes wrong
1468 lets say you have a hewlett packard computer and you call hp technical support they wont tell you they are going to charge you but however long you are on the phone if it is a half hour they end up billing it to the phone bill they find out later that that one half hour call cost them x number of dollars
1469 once things go wrong and youve exhausted your resources just like when you are sick sometimes you have to call the doctor sometimes you need somebody to help you out because its keeping you from getting your work done
1470 if mccain picked a woman it would certainly get the attention and perhaps votes of some democrats and a number of independents who supported hillary clinton
1471 shes got it all and is a remarkable leader who brings a number of good qualities to the table
1472 this fall theres going to be a lot of energy surrounding the obama campaign and we need to find ways to generate a substantial amount of energy around the mccain campaign and an effective dynamic different kind of vice presidential nominee i think would make a difference
1473 a mother of five is a genuine alaskan is a hunter is a dogsledder is very much for drilling for oil has a great reform reputation took on big oil on behalf of the people of alaska
1474 i think she would bring a level of excitement and uniqueness that people would have to stop and say boy this is kind of intriguing
1475 we are not suggesting that it organizations stay away from blades blades do address many problems in the data center
1476 what we are saying is that it organizations adopting blades need to be prepared for further changes in this technology
1477 organizations must recognize that blade adoption needs to be a strategic vendor partnership decision and not a tactical purchase
1478 i am pleased that our stockholders have followed the recommendation of the eds board of directors and supported the combination of eds and hp
1479 not only does the combination of these two great companies create immediate value for our stockholders it also enhances our ability to achieve our customers needs with our unwavering commitment to quality and innovation
1480 if the facts are against you argue the law if the law is against you argue the facts if both are against you attack your opponent
1481 hmm so is the trochoidal a machine is it a piece of machine or is it a piece of math
1482 breves aleta de tibur n y un nuevo acercamiento entre ferrari y alonso
1483 will begin a dialogue where people will open their hearts and their minds to the problems that face this country
1484 its not something any critical mass of constituents were clamouring for which makes the exercise even more hollow
1485 im just not convinced that a federal apology has any weight
1486 to rectify the lingering consequences of the misdeeds committed against african americans under slavery and jim crow and to stop the occurrence of human rights violations in the future
1487 if you dont follow the apology with action talk is cheap talk is less expensive than reparations
1488 we heard this blood curdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy sitting next to him repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
1489 when he was attacking him he was calm it was like he was at the beach
1490 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
1491 he went back to his seat and brought the head to the front and pretty much displayed it to us like that and then dropped it on the ground in front of us
1492 the incident was very tragic but was an isolated event
1493 bus travel has been and remains the safest mode of travel in the country
1494 this particular incident as horrific as it is is obviously extremely rare
1495 certainly the horrific nature of it is probably one of a kind in canadian history
1496 it is im sorry to say that it is theres no place in this campaign for that
1497 played the race card and played it from the bottom of the deck
1498 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
1499 so far all we have heard is paris hilton and britney spears
1500 i have to ask my opponent is that the best you can come up with
1501 hillary hated on you so that bitch is irrelevant mccain dont belong in any chair unless hes paralysed yeah i said it cos bush is mentally handicapped
1502 as barack obama has said rap lyrics too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
1503 hes a tough guy to play against because hes so unpredictable
1504 i feel like ive got a good game to play against him because he obviously likes guys who give him some rhythm and i obviously try not to
1505 youre fired you were rubbish anyway you have no future your home has been demolished and ive killed your dog
1506 this is the way the world ends not with a bang but a whimper
1507 the fairest possible distribution of the necessities and comforts of daily life
1508 it was a time when churchill perceiving the dangers that lay ahead struggled to mobilise the political will and industrial energy of the british empire to meet those dangers he did so often in the face of strong opposition
1509 climate change is the gathering storm of our generation and the implications should we fail to act could be no less dire and perhaps even more so
1510 oil companies are increasingly dependent on these unconventionals as they get squeezed out of countries such as nigeria and russia we fear tar sands are just the entrance ramp to oil shale gas to liquids and other non conventionals which will just press the red button for climate change disaster
1511 this government has reached an end national responsibility requires a return to the people and new elections
1512 the most failed and corrupt leader in the history of israel
1513 the disgusting actions of this group of anti chinese lawmakers
1514 exposed evil motives to politicise the olympics and interrupt and sabotage the beijing olympics
1515 by arranging such a meeting between its leader and these people and making irresponsible remarks on chinas human rights and religious situation the us side has rudely interfered in chinas internal affairs and sent a seriously wrong message to anti china hostile forces
1516 moreover gdp growth in the preceding two quarters was revised down in particular the economy is now estimated to have contracted by 0 2 in q4 of last year raising the possibility that the national bureau of economic research will eventually conclude that the recession began during the final three months of 2007

1520 what is quite clear is that lucas is determined to stop mr ainsworth by whatever legitimate legal means are open to it including the threat of a 10m judgment hanging over him
1521 makes it clear that lucasfilm and george lucas are the rightful owners of the copyrights related to star wars we do not intend to use this ruling to discourage our fans from expressing their imagination creativity and passion for star wars through the costumes and props they make for their personal use rather we see the courts decision as reaffirming that those who seek to illegally profit from star wars will be brought to task

1528 people will tell you how much star wars means to them fan culture is all sorts of things it can be geeks in costumes who havent showered for two weeks or ordinary looking people who received their love of star wars from their parents and have in turn passed it on to their children
1529 the live action movies were really centred on the skywalker family and weve never gotten to see the full breadth of the conflict
1530 we grew up with star wars we really believe in it
1531 you have to handle fans as a fellow fan and you cant talk down to them fans are smart if they smell bullshit theyre not going to jump into it

1533 the difference between the american system and our own is not perhaps so stark as the appellants argument suggests
1534 it is difficult to think of anything other than the threat of unlawful action which could fairly be said so to imperil the integrity of the extradition process as to require the accused to be discharged irrespective of the case against him
1535 ive been telling my agent for years that i wanted an action movie but no one saw me like that
1536 two weeks before my 40th birthday i guess id given up i mean how many action roles are there for women over 40 soon after that i got a call to say they were considering me for the part

1540 id given birth to my son the year before and i was about 40lbs overweight
1541 so many actors say you have to find something you like in each character ive never bought that i think there are people in the world who are plain mean not many but some so thats how i decided to play her without sympathy

1556 i have to ask my opponent is that the best you can come up with
1557 hillary hated on you so that bitch is irrelevant mccain dont belong in any chair unless hes paralysed yeah i said it cos bush is mentally handicapped

1584 our technology helps businesses answer the two fundamental questions of what to protect and from whom
1585 mcafee will be better equipped to help organizations address the complexity and time involved in the deployment and management of data protection
1586 not many boys can get ready in six months it takes a lot of dedication and sacrifice

1589 freezing the country teachers incentive scheme and ushering in a system which simply targets specific schools and subjects in need will devastate schools in regional and remote areas
1590 also by targeting payments to secondary teachers women will again be the losers since 98 percent of the junior primary workforce in south australia are women compared with about 50 50 in secondary schools
1591 bureaucrats believe that being in the country doesnt make any difference however we know the country schools are having trouble attracting qualified staff
1592 what we are proposing is a scheme that helps to attract more teachers with specialist skills into our schools
1593 some schools are finding it difficult to attract teachers with skills in mathematics science technology home economics and special education
1594 we are discussing with the unions the possibility of an allowance to attract and retain teachers with these skills
1595 to suggest that only men teach these subjects is offensive to women

1597 i was not a good husband and although i had some good moments i would slip back into my selfish lifestyle believing life was all about me
1598 i had been raised in the baptist church and all my life i had known of god but never knew him until my wife and i began working through a failed marriage
1599 i remember the pain was so great that i reached out to god and really prayed
1600 god does not rub it in he rubs it out
1601 no one will speak in favor not all of the ratepayers are here
1602 all of these people here tonight do not come from this area there has been a lot of scare mongering in port germein
1603 despite stephen vormister and mrs perovic saying that the rates wont go up it does not take an einstein to realise they will
1604 but someone put up a notice in the post office
1605 i remember one morning i was heading for a roundabout when an angelic grade one student pulled the pin on the fire extinguisher covering myself and the windscreen with a sea of green foam and it was only due to the angel on my shoulder that we and a few kids on bikes escaped serious injury
1606 i felt privileged to have been involved with an event which obviously was a special occasion for a group of young adults who face challenges every day
1607 i want to thank all who offered me challenges in my life and had faith in me they know who they are for without them my life would not have been half as interesting or fulfilling

1614 im currently packing up really quick to hop on the plane and head to new york for a second opinion but i wanted to let all of you know first that theres no chance of me competing in beijing the timing is so unfortunate and this makes me more sad than anything

1636 lo que dice la biblia sobre el amor eterno es mentira ning n hombre ama a una mujer del mismo modo toda la vida por eso invent el contrato conductual conyugal para tratar a las parejas que tienen problemas si hasta para comprar un ticket de avi n uno necesita firmar un contrato c mo no va a tener el matrimonio un contrato que debe ser negociado no se or la fase de la luna de miel va a pasar de modo que cada cierto tiempo hay que determinar las bases del contrato de pareja
1637 el otro d a en una reuni n de la comisi n parlamentaria sobre seguridad hice pasar un momento dif cil a algunos diputados cuando dije que todos los l deres que yo hab a conocido o presupon a conocer eran hombres autoritarios dije que yo no hab a conocido a cristo pero que estaba seguro de que cristo tambi n hab a sido un l der autoritario y a ad que no importaba el rea en que hab an aplicado su autoritarismo para no hablar de pinochet o de hitler sino que la personalidad del l der es necesariamente autoritaria cada l der la maneja a su manera como ghandi pero el autoritarismo es propio de quien ejerce el poder por cierto que se ofendieron un poco las diputadas cristianas porque yo estaba insinuando que cristo no es dios

1640 bol var fue un asesino un demagogo que le robo las ideas a miranda
1641 the only problem i had was that the steering wheel was on the wrong side
1642 we figured we had expired all our expertise and we needed someone to take us to the next level
1643 like any program as they develop we had to develop other clubs around the state are doing the same thing its getting to be where you almost have to hire a director of coaching
1644 someone was waiting for me at the airport and ive been looked after ever since
1645 i feel a little like royalty the way ive been treated
1646 he certainly had the same ideas and philosophies we had
1647 his references sold the whole thing it was an our gain their loss deal with all of them sorry to hear he was leaving
1648 he wants to take it slow and observe things and go to a couple games here and go to a couple games in portland to scope out the competition
1649 development programs have to be age appropriate and skill appropriate it takes some time to work through it
1650 i still have contacts with manchester united because ive been involved with them since i was about 4 years old
1651 through those contacts we were able to become the western australian development club
1652 my involvement into soccer was getting so much that i was more or less two jobs
1653 i was in holland in 1984 and it was the first time i saw the small sided games
1654 i really liked what i saw it has a huge impact on kids and its the way to go
1655 it may not have been exactly where some of these guys wanted to be but they have worked their tails off
1656 on that particular day he made that choice and felt that it wasnt necessary the reality in this particular instance chances are it wouldnt have made any difference
1657 red bull flugtag challenges teams of everyday people to build homemade human powered flying machines and pilot them off a 30 foot high deck in hopes of achieving flight
1658 my friend just looked me up and down and said youre the pilot
1659 when we were getting gung ho about the idea we said whod be willing to pilot
1660 and i firmly and cheerfully encourage my county commissioners to instruct your county employees to do a lot better job
1661 and in my job i cant choose which state laws im going to enforce and not enforce
1662 having a bunch of extra signs in intersections is detrimental to traffic safety
1663 this is our opportunity as a family within the store to pick somebody to help
1664 these ones touch a little closer to home for us
1665 itll be nice when its all painted and the carpet is in
1666 it allows activists to file lawsuits more easily based on claims that industrial activity will harm the species
1667 clearly efforts need to be made to protect species but the methods under which that is done shouldnt put species before people
1668 when we file suit well have to provide more information on the impact of the polar bear listing on the clients
1669 were going to need to establish the link between our claim and the actual impacts
1670 one of reason we felt we needed to be involved in this suit is because the alaska suit does not cover all the objections
1671 there are indications that the suspects had a reason for choosing the location
1672 i just looked at him and i said what are you doing
1673 this is a strong arm robbery we need to get to california fast
1674 when dr knee hip comes in he is going to ask me maybe 3 questions touch 1 place and then i will scream he is a very dangerous man
1675 for a beautiful rubia like you i would cut it off
1676 yes the argentine man is so wonderful until he knows he has you he is willing to do anything even cut his head off
1677 for the milonga i would cut my head off for you no more i live for the milonga and to dance with you inside the milonga outside the milong there is no milonga
1678 maybe you do not want to be but you are
1679 nena come to my milonga some time i miss you
1680 you know there is a lot of food to eat
1681 i dont really like the taste of it i mean i eat chicken and seafood before i came here i didnt eat chicken
1682 koreans dont eat chicken they eat meat and maybe a little seafood meat is very important in the korean diet
1683 it will be ok food and me always works out
1684 you know i sit here all night and listen to argentines say shitty things about how the foreigners dance tango how the foreigners ruin tango fine you are correct but argentines do not dance rock and roll you dance some other dance where did rock and roll come from the usa now you call this dance foxtrot and it is not foxtrot where did foxtrot come from the usa why is it argentines can screw up everyone elses dances and say it is ok
1685 who knows i dont think i will ever understand these men here they are too weird for me
1686 hopefully i will go out and shoot an even better round tomorrow
1687 i love the game so i still want to come out and play but retirement is getting closer ill play the rest of this year and then re evaluate
1688 it just seems that i cannot put 18 holes together
1689 its just so disappointing that i dont seem to be able to pull it together
1690 im thrilled to be a part of this organisation for the long term
1691 chicago is where i have always wanted to be im looking forward to getting back on the court with my teammates and helping this team get back to the playoffs
1692 signing luol has always been a priority for this organisation and we have always felt that he was a big part of our future
1693 we are very happy that luol will now be with us long term as we continue to grow as an organisation
1694 with manny in the middle of the lineup it will certainly get other peoples attention it is not going to be easy in pitchers minds to get through this lineup
1695 it was just five months before the qualifying window for the 2008 olympics opened and it seemed crazy for a seasoned shooter like me to undergo a total change from my shooting style to my equipment
1696 i had to un learn and re learn everything over a span of 15 months basically whatever id learnt through trial and error over the last 20 odd years had to be thrown out
1697 marcello stressed a lot on my shooting stance and the timing
1698 every shot i took was carefully structured and prepared unlike the past when id just turn up and shoot
1699 his attention to detail is also very great he would make me shoot the same target at the same trajectory over and over again until i got it right
1700 it was very intense and there were moments of friction between us
1701 marcello also knew when to take it easy sometimes he would take all of us into town and head for this spa for elderly people for us to relax
1702 i dont know if it is going to be my last olympics it will depend on what resources are available
1703 but if there are better trap shooters then i would be happy to make way for them
1704 it was a special day and my whole family came up
1705 when i hit two home runs i was kind of puffing my chest until my dad said well those balls in your high school field probably would have been flyouts to right but dont worry about it
1706 for us to get the second round were getting some really good teams
1707 its going to be great games in our pool and with the international diversity of south florida a lot of people are going to see their countries play whether its the dominican or venezuela puerto rico u s a canada
1708 people are going to come out and watch these games and the passion for their country will certainly be on display
1709 i think by baseball selecting us its sending a nice message to everybody about how strongly they feel about miami and the support we have for baseball
1710 i think it exemplifies mlbs dedication to miami and i think its a great step for us
1711 we have to sell baseball at the grassroots level and our fan base has to grow significantly by the time we get into the new facility and the more people who are exposed to baseball i think it helps us sell the game to people and helps people become a fan of baseball
1712 i was confident that we had a really good chance just because the efforts and the quality of our proposal both financially and with the detail we attended to it
1713 i feel like we responded very favorably to all the expectations
1714 this is the gateway to the americas and i think it was a natural destination for mlb
1715 we hope to demonstrate the uniqueness of our location the quality of the diversity of this marketplace and we think that combination with the timing of the season with tourism at its peak can generate positive results
1716 i think theyll be highly motivated to think about us again in the future to host the games
1717 we didnt have a lot of time to get it done so it tends to move a lot faster the last 24 hours i was surprised they obviously had a need for another bat in their lineup and a need for another outfielder i know white sox gm kenny williams had interest in junior in the past and looked at this as a good opportunity to add him to his club
1718 he thought about it and said he wanted to talk to his family about it i think its a very good opportunity for him they obviously wanted him pursued him and came after him thats got to be a good feeling for him i guess
1719 it was a lot more brief than i thought it was going to be
1720 it was kind of shocking all of sudden bam it was done he is still going to be a friend of mine im upset that hes leaving but its a good situation for him he wants to win a ring the white sox are in first place and he has a chance
1721 he wasnt having his best year but he was just getting hot
1722 you wont be able to fill those shoes no one is ken griffey jr its the end of an era in cincinnati he got hurt a lot but was one of the top five best to ever step on the field
1723 hes one of the best four or five hitters in baseball
1724 i like him yet he marches to his own drummer i had him in the all star game it doesnt make sense to me that he would be available
1725 we had some things that we were looking at that we were trying to improve mainly with the pen and we did that with rhodes
1726 we were trying to add catching depth and we banged on i think every door if we didnt its our fault as far as any other opportunities yes there were other opportunities that we wanted to explore because we like to be active with the minutes ticking we wanted to take advantage of it why some of those things didnt come to fruition could be a number of factors it could be the money the players to somebody else had different goals than we did
1727 we had conversations that went right down to the wire
1728 and whenever you have that obviously you feel like theres a chance but it takes two teams and by definition trades are difficult to make and weve worked extremely hard the last couple of weeks to try and find a pick and improve the team but at the end of the day we didnt find something that lined up for us
1729 i know there was a lot out there the way we view that is that the trade deadline is an opportunity for us to examine ways to improve our club we did that we had a lot of discussions a few of them led right up to the deadline but obviously nothing came to fruition
1730 we exchanged proposals in a couple of instances but nothing to the point were i was calling owner tom hicks for the final signoff
1731 the last four or five days obviously weve been in a lot of discussions and a lot of meetings and talked over a lot of different scenarios
1732 but we were never real close to what i would call making a deal
1733 negotiations with aek reached a happy end now with my teammates i will try to reach this years goals ones that are of course high
1734 we got a report wednesday night that hes improving but still feels it when he runs
1735 hes healthy just tired he knew monday that he would rest so this was just a good day for him

1742 even though im not really into vampires i enjoy the books
1743 theyre not really bloody or gory theyre more romantic and passionate
1744 are you going to give me a ticket or a warning

1766 many of the issues effecting farmers back then still plague us today
1767 the nature of the problems has changed a lot but farmers and the organisation have adapted amazingly over the years to show great improvements in productivity environmental care and understanding of the international markets
1768 it is even worse today compounded by the drought over the past decade the high australian dollar and subsidised international competition making the economics of farming very difficult
1769 these men along with many other members have helped build the association the knowledge and experience they have is incredible

1788 said they were very confident of their ability to predict what their newsrooms would look like five years from now
1789 the majority of bloggers and internet addicts like the endless rows of talking heads on television do not report
1790 they are largely parasites who cling to traditional news outlets they rarely pick up the phone much less go out and find a story nearly all reporting i would guess at least 80 percent is done by newspapers and the wire services take that away and we have a huge black hole

1792 with the american housing market in its worst crisis since the great depression of the 1930s president bush is authorising new legislation to pave the way for massive new government intervention designed to slow the slide
1793 second while our overall growth has outpaced inflation americas income has also become much more highly concentrated at the top the paychecks of 9 out of 10 americans have actually declined over the past three decades its been bill gates and his set who have done extremely well during that time as a result of both of these shifts theres now a significant gap between the economy in which most americans live and work and the one discussed in the business pages and on the cable news blab fests

1813 were going to see what we can do about the mysterious mr mikell
1814 hes got a long way to go lots of surgery hell need prosthesis
1815 but its kind of a hike to get to it and there is no supervision there

1818 it was all together but it was a blueish colour
1819 the urgent problem with reattaching a limb is getting blood supply to the muscle as soon as possible
1820 after four hours without blood you begin to get irreversible damage to the muscle and if the muscle dies it can become infected
1821 never before in an election cycle has so much attention turned to the youth vote and luke will bring a unique perspective to covering it
1822 im not trying to be my father hes irreplaceable im simply trying to do something that i think theres a real niche for that theres a calling for that has to do with youth not just in the election but in politics from now on
1823 weve mobilized a fair amount of equipment and well do whatever it takes to get the road open as fast as we can
1824 we have complete confidence in the ministry of transportation that when the road is complete were going to have minimal issues with it and its going to be safe

1826 in the aftermath of the slide those people that had flights out or commitments had to do a bit of scrambling but now people are generally ok
1827 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed
1828 we heard this blood curdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
1829 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
1830 we put our bodies up against the door waiting for him to come out and he went back and brought the head to the front and pretty much displayed it and dropped it on the ground in front of us
1831 all very calmly he was wearing sunglasses it was no big deal to him

1839 theres got to be some changes to the investigation process allowing for some sort of civilian investigation especially in really serious allegations in custody deaths and serious injuries
1840 these are the cases that immediately should be taken out of the hands of internal police forces
1841 its people wanting that satisfaction having an honest belief that what they really want is for the officer not to do that again and be disciplined for what they thought was wrong and just not having an avenue to do it
1842 one of the changes that im personally aware of is increasing the oversight role of the office of the police complaint commissioner throughout the process of an investigation so it will provide additional independent oversight pretty much from the start of an investigation
1843 the police officer who broke my arm should be charged with assault causing bodily harm at the very least
1844 the most disturbing thing about this is that theyre behaving like its a police state
1845 im a citizen of canada with charter rights i pay my taxes ergo i pay their salaries and theyve sworn an oath to serve and protect me
1846 it has been my observation that in sensitive and serious investigations that the resolve of internal investigators to vigorously investigate their own members will too often stand in marked distinction to the approach the same investigators might take with a civilian accused of the same conduct
1847 resulta conveniente fortalecer los mecanismos existentes para intercambiar informaci n reforzar la capacidad investigativa de nuestras instituciones y mejorar las herramientas de cooperaci n judicial y policial ya existentes
1848 se ha avanzado pero se insiste mucho en que no quede s lo en las conclusiones y en las actas sino que se pasen a compromisos efectivos ya que es un problema global
1849 eso lo que lleva es a seguir concientizando a los pa ses en el tema de la necesidad de la responsabilidad compartida de la cooperaci n entre los pa ses en poder controlar tanto la migraci n de los traficantes como el lavado de activos y el tr fico de estupefacientes
1850 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue

1859 we have two different projects that are at least vaguely in the works on the iphone
1860 pure graphics wise the iphone is about equivalent to a dreamcast but if you were to compare it to a console its pretty close to a previous generation console
1861 while the graphics arent that high up youve got a lot more ram
1862 armani jeans expresses my vision of a young independent casual lifestyle with a strong and cool fashion sensibility solange epitomises this style perfectly and brings to it that swing so evident in her new single i decided

1864 we have ab unch of new stuff that were going to show here
1865 because it seems that senator obama has made his decision to offer the slot on the ticket to another candidate we believe that continuing to ask him to pick hillary is no longer helpful to our partys chances of winning in november
1866 thats when reality hit i just sat there in the middle of the track with the snow coming down just numb thinking im sick of this im sick of the injuries
1867 im thinking i havent run without pain for six years now im getting married soon im about to become a father im not making any money i just dont want to do this any more
1868 the only thing i remember is people jumping out at me and offering me prawns on a fork or a can of fosters afterwards i felt like a complete loser someone just making up the numbers

1878 epas irresponsible inappropriate decision has failed navajo communities and needlessly sacrificed our air land and water
1879 it is a devastating blow to tribal members who continually suffer from the large coal complex encroaching upon our land
1880 this air permit seriously undermines regional efforts to clean up the air and promote renewable energy projects
1881 if the coal plant is built it will add to health problems already facing tribal members and residents of both new mexico and colorado
1882 this is a political decision not one based on science or epas own mandate
1883 epa ramrodded this permit out the door in response to a lawsuit filed by the coal plant owner whose lawyer jeff holmstead was a high level epa official in the bush administration it looks like hes still giving orders to epas staff
1884 is epas rush to judgment on this permit decision sithe complains that the epa should have issued the permit several years ago but the whole reason this is taking so long is because the concept for desert rock is faulty epa still hasnt finished a thorough evaluation of the project but its allowing a former agency official to bully it into rushing this permit out the door
1885 we plan to vigorously contest the permit to prevent a tremendous setback to the efforts of state and local governments and dedicated citizens to rein in global warming pollution and to protect the health of area residents
1886 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
1887 according to one gop strategist i spoke with over the weekend they had an ad script ready to go if obama had visited the wounded troops saying that obama was wait for it using wounded troops as campaign props so no matter which way obama turned mccain had an obama bashing ad ready to launch

1895 there were years the club didnt win as many games as it lost the chicken provided one of the most crucial elements of any baseball game enhancing the fan experience he always complemented the game
1896 we abuse land because we regard it as a commodity belonging to us when we see land as a community to which we belong we may begin to use it with love and respect
1897 great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds
1898 something had to be done it took me a little while and some very frustrating prototypes but eventually i did it
1899 my child would never do that are you sure it was my child

1904 everyone with the red cross was patient helpful and sympathetic
1905 as a former auditor chaudhry would know that all audits are checked out against laid down general amp finance orders and any transaction that is done outside the stipulated general orders becomes questionable
1906 yet here we have a former auditor now minister supporting an unbudgeted payment while the current auditor general has not commented until announcing the investigation
1907 and even if there are cases where accrued leave is paid it is usually for a limited period of time only

1910 what happened to loraine tevi and sereana qoro reflects on how far the church can go to threaten people and i appeal to them to go easy on us because i am also a methodist and i have the right to choose
1911 the church cannot let us choose between our faith and our families because we need to earn a living to support our families
1912 hopefully before they leave within the next day or so they would have signed a memorandum of association moa thereafter well proceed to build the facilities for them

1916 intensive research has been devoted to the development of hypoglycemia alarms
1917 hypoglycemia alarm dogs could provide an important aid to patients with poor awareness of symptoms particularly those prone to night time episodes or who live alone
1918 pets may help patients with type 1 diabetes through aiding them when hypoglycemic
1919 reduced awareness of hypoglycemia and does not wake up during nocturnal episodes
1920 take canine glucose sensing to a new level of sophistication
1921 all were clearly able to sense hypoglycemia accurately under circumstances when the patients themselves were initially unaware of falling glucose levels
1922 formal calculations of sensitivity and specificity are not possible but each dog showed his or her specific behaviors only when the patient had documented hypoglycemia
1923 research is urgently needed to determine whether dogs can be trained to recognize and react to early signs of hypoglycemia
1924 dexter is my baby and has never sat on the couch with anyone but me
1925 if i am not in the room he sits on the floor
1926 she was not aware of her low blood sugar as soon as i fed her and got her blood sugars to come back up dexter was back on the floor laying in his usual spot
1927 i thought maybe it was just a coincidence but the next time i saw dexter sitting with becka and licking her face i immediately grabbed the meter even though it was not testing time
1928 she was 54 mg dl that time she had not felt any of these lows herself but the dog had
1929 becka knows that if dexter licks her incessantly to test her sugar and tell me or her dad
1930 every time he has licked her she has been low he seems to be able to pick up anything below 60 mg dl
1931 at first i thought it was just coincidence however it has happened too many times over the last three years
1932 i dont know if i thrash mumble snore or breathe differently when my blood sugar levels drop but regardless she is always pushing me with her paws
1933 she takes a running start and hits me with both her front paws
1934 frosty was a lifesaver in waking me up when i was sleeping and incurring a low blood sugar
1935 after a few weeks i realized that just before i did my finger sticks she began to whine and cry
1936 on days when i would tell her its not good today she would bring me her rawhide chew
1937 when i have a hypo and head for the truck the young and middle aged dogs follow and jump in excitement
1938 my cat angora whom ive had for about 15 years woke me up on one occasion by pawing at me and meowing to get my attention
1939 it was a time in my life before i was married and before i was in tight control so i didnt have very many lows
1940 democracy now kucinich keeps rolling that impeach boulder over mt pelosi
1941 i thought that impeachment would be divisive for the country
1942 so that americans can really see the crimes bush and cheney have committed
1943 ifsomebody had a crime bush had committed sic that would be different
1944 i thought that impeachment would be divisive for the country
1945 well i think that it i think it was important when i became speaker and its by the way a very important position i saw it as my responsibility to try to bring a much divided country together to the extent that we could
1946 and you cant do that if youre trying to impeach the president at the same time unless you have the goods that this president committed crimes
1947 i thought that impeachment would be divisive for the country
1948 the most common of all follies is to believe passionately in the palpably not true it is the chief occupation of mankind

1956 its important to note that this was not a weight loss study
1957 the participants could eat whatever they wanted they could have been eating dessert every night no one told them not to
1958 insulin delivery based on carbohydrate counting is the gold standard for improving glycemic control in type 1 diabetes
1959 if the diabetes is recognized sooner it can be treated sooner this leads to a longer life a better quality of life and lower medical related costs over the life span of the patient
1960 most patients we diagnose come to us because of a sudden change in vision maybe their vision is blurry and they have never worn glasses and they are concerned we are often the first doctor they see we end up being the ones who determine they have diabetes and refer them to other medical experts for follow up treatment
1961 everybody has to get on the same page when it comes to treating the person with diabetes
1962 from the eye doctor the dentist the podiatrist and the family doctor to the endocrinologist we all have to know whats going on with the patient and the patient needs to understand the ramifications of the disease
1963 to join in a day of prayer and fasting that such offenses never happen again
1964 we dont talk as much about the experience of illness as we talk about how to get over it how to stop it how to prevent it how to relieve it how you can be healthy if you really try we dont look inside the suffering past the wall of suffering to see whats behind it i think theres an enormous body of knowledge out there among people who are suffering that is untapped and if we could tap into it more wed be less afraid and wed know more how to cope when it happens to us
1965 any establishment which dispenses food for consumption on or off the premises and which has the following characteristics a limited menu items prepared in advance or prepared or heated quickly no table orders and food served in disposable wrapping or containers
1966 man f rst r sig inte p hur snuskiga folk kan vara men det verkar som om man st tt och kissat rakt in i kaklet p toaletterna
1967 problemet r att de inte tar p sig ett par rena kalsonger under badbyxorna utan att de har anv nts minst en dag eller flera det finns helt ekelt m nsklig avf ring i kalsongerna
1968 there are matters which have arisen which would have caused anybody very considerable concern
1969 the evidence has demonstrated that the practice of beasting which clearly falls outside appropriate military discipline was going on in these barracks openly and must have been known to senior officers
1970 many will have found it unpalatable that the order from captain davis to bring this man to them hot and sweaty was an order that the defendants found themselves having to comply with this sort of activity should not be condoned and mustnt be allowed to happen again and this lesson must be clearly relayed to those in charge
1971 the conclusion of the trial allows the royal military police now to conduct a full investigation into his death
1972 this will examine whether there were any breaches of military law a decision can then be made on further action i am unable to comment until this investigation concludes
1973 left no stone unturned in their effort to establish the full circumstances
1974 we are devastated with the outcome of the verdicts today we have come this far we owe it to gavin that nobody elses child goes through what happened to gavin
1975 we have all been hung out to dry its been really stressful i feel great sympathy for gavin williams family beasting is happening all the time the army should address it
1976 i really do struggle to see why we make it so easy for people to fly domestically when you have got such a low carbon alternative in rail its something that should be positively promoted
1977 we want to get more inbound and outbound flight rotations at stansted but we would like to get to the position where all trips between london and edinburgh are done by train
1978 i subscribe to the view that you will see people taking more uk holidays
1979 there are an awful lot of smoky old diesel trains out there the lowest carbon alternative is eurostar and you have to recognise that it is mostly powered by nuclear generated electricity
1980 the commissions view is that it would not be able to issue finalised guidance in this area until the relevant primary legislation had received royal assent and the commission had carefully considered the wider context in which guidance would operate and consulted widely on the content of the guidance
1981 the commission also strongly supports the recommendation from the review of the 2007 scottish elections that no changes to the rules surrounding elections should be applied to an election held within six months of those changes coming into force
1982 it is a perfectly understandable reaction on the part of the electoral commission they could well end up in a situation where they are called on to address whether a candidates expenses are political without legal clarity at which point they know they will face all sorts of challenges
1983 a london guide for the soul if there ever was one you can laugh and cry on the same page
1984 it needs better lighting but luckily for my summer mood i was let off without demands for re writes
1985 the difference between the american system and our own is not perhaps so stark as the appellants argument suggests
1986 it is difficult to think of anything other than the threat of unlawful action which could fairly be said so to imperil the integrity of the extradition process as to require the accused to be discharged irrespective of the case against him
1987 the post office card account is vital for the future stability of the post office if the government does not award the contract to the post office it could sound the deathknell for the countrys network of post offices
1988 losing the post office card account contract would undermine the sustainability of the post office network and would inevitably lead to the closure of around 3 000 post offices
1989 the impact would be felt by the most vulnerable in society those least able to travel to an alternative outlet due to poor transport availability economic geographic or mobility factors in addition to more job losses
1990 had a text message drawn him away from the falling apple at just the wrong moment

1994 two others said they had knowledge of human remains at the location but were not specific a local advocate also came to police and said he had a client who knew there were human remains buried at the home
1995 if the dating remains as inconclusive as what we have had so far a homicide inquiry is unlikely

2000 i drive to the station every day and i get the train to work
2001 my carbon footprint is not particularly good i need to plant a forest immediately
2002 the perceived cost of motoring has gone up so people are questioning how often they use their cars
2003 something is different people are using trains more because of motoring costs and other factors such as congestion maybe we have gone through that tipping point
2004 i can imagine that he would be a pretty exacting guy to work for
2005 thats probably still true i am more tolerant than i used to be there is a limit though when you rely on other people and you have to do your job through them
2006 its not until the trade unions punch you in the eyes and say no that you turn into an older and wiser manager those that never have to experience the word no are poorer for it
2007 it was a wholly political decision it was from no 10 and the department for transport was told to get on with it i am sticking my neck out but i dont really care
2008 i am not surprised inevitably on value for money you are always going to get poor results if that rate of fare increase continues it is going to feel more and more expensive particularly when people might be feeling the pinch
2009 im giving myself enough rope but i would like to retain this franchise if i can do that i feel it will be job done
2010 when i started my career people talked down buses i had a rather strange job to a lot of people
2011 there is a huge challenge in the bus industry to replace my generation that joined in the 1970s early in my career we managed decline as car ownership increased and the use of buses fell away now we are on the cusp of an opportunity to start building again and we need new young managers to help with the process
2012 the time for consideration of such a drastic measure has not yet been reached it would be premature at the present time strict enforcement would have undesirable effects on relations between police and public many of whom would justifiably resent prosecutions and convictions relating to failure to take precautions which in no way affect the safety of any other road users
2013 there is no doubt that the police would incur unpopularity any further deterioration in the good relationship between police and public is to be deplored but it is difficult to see how this could be avoided
2014 a patrol car driver would have the additional difficulty of taking his eyes from the road to check vehicles which he passes
2015 dwarfs and persons who are deformed grossly obese exceptionally tall or have other permanent physical characteristics
2016 some old people opposed or indifferent to seat belts would deprive themselves of the pleasure they get from a car outing rather than put up with the nuisance involved in what they regard as an unnecessary newfangled idea most old people are law abiding and the conflict between conscience and desire to go for a drive with the family is easy to foresee
2017 women who object to the feel of the belt over their breasts should not be exempted the evidence also indicates that if an impact is of sufficient force to kill an unborn child the collision would be of such severity that the mother would probably be killed unless she was wearing a seat belt a woman who wears a belt and survives while her baby dies does not sacrifice her unborn childs life she simply avoids the futile sacrifice of her own
2018 life is short the art is long opportunity fleeting experience delusive judgment difficult

2023 what is happening in this country is something we never knew before
2024 there is a callousness in this society it is ungodly
2025 considering how it could have been it is relatively minor injuries lots of walking wounded
2026 everyone involved has been incredibly lucky if it hadnt been for the soft landing on the verge i think the injuries would have been a lot more serious
2027 if the bus had rolled on to the roadside rather than on to gorse it could have been more serious the driver did his best to get the casualties out of the bus so they were very lucky

2035 we both came into the profession in the 80s when there was a generation of young lawyers concerned about miscarriages of justice and making the law more accessible not speaking arcane language that no one could understand you would not find keir customarily in wing collar and stripy trousers
2036 traditionally the police have had their hands on the prosecution of cases and that has to change it has to be more of a partnership with the prosecuting lawyer following the case through taking the ultimate decisions prosecutors have an ethical obligation to decide in the public interest there is no incongruity that someone who has been a defence lawyer should know best how to look at a case from the other side
2037 whenever one of us left home they replaced us with a donkey
2038 i had the idea of changing things for the better i was always interested in constitutional issues and politics i thought id become a solicitor but then the idea of actually presenting an argument being the person who got up in court began to appeal

2052 one of the biggest mistakes our school system has made in the last decade was eliminating the alternative school i think it would be awesome if you became an english teacher and brought back the alternative school your professional and academic success having come through an alternative school yourself would be an inspiration for many of the students who mistakenly believe or have been repeatedly told they have no value and no future as for teaching hunter s thompson i have doubts that the school board would approve this author even though his works have clear literary value because of the graphic and adult nature of his novels
2053 for this particular product i will be revisiting whether we keep it in the market or not once we have clarified things we may pull this particular one where it goes to the lawyer specifically for the down payment
2054 the hard part of getting water to split is not the hydrogen platinum as a catalyst works fine for the hydrogen but platinum works very poorly for oxygen making you use much more energy
2055 what we have done is made a catalyst work for the oxygen part without any extra energy in fact with our catalyst almost 100 percent of the current used for electrolysis goes into making oxygen and hydrogen
2056 nickel oxide cant be used around anything else in the environment because of corrosion even the carbon dioxide in the air will react with it to make carbonates
2057 but our catalyst uses abundant materials that dont react with environment
2058 because our catalyst is green the machines that perform electrolysis can be much less expensive than they are today since they dont need to be protected from environmental contaminants
2059 solar cell makers can add super cheap electrolyzers to their system so that they work 24 7 during the day making hydrogen and oxygen then at night recombining it in fuel cells to generate electricity
2060 i dont think anything that went on in these chambers affected him
2061 his entire life as best i can tell is one in which hes always been a thoughtful listener and questioner but hes never stepped up to the plate and taken full swings

2117 all the passengers had to spend the night on the planes or in the departure hall
2118 no one came to tend to their food and board
2119 the car was picked up by the water and washed under the fence
2120 there was a hollow under the fence his car was sucked through that and 200 300 metres out into paddocks by the time we got there some bystanders had got him out of the car and he was sitting on a grassy nob just beyond it
2121 three quarters of his car was under water if they hadnt got him out he mightnt have made it
2122 we went in there with a scoop stretcher and a couple of guys and brought him back through the water to the road
2123 he was swept into the paddock and stayed in the car until some locals and the fire service got him out they were standing in water that was at least waist deep

2130 john mccain and the republicans they dont have any new ideas thats why theyre spending all their time talking about me
2131 but since they dont have any new ideas the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
2132 when you are working in an existing building you dont know what you will encounter until you begin work and tear down walls it covers anything you cant see
2133 its not an overly high amount but it should cover the town should anything happen in the building the building is in unknown condition right now and the money will be there if is its needed or go back if its not

2135 i think in the end the sccf committee and the bos have demonstrated responsible leadership by providing a plan for a beautiful new home for our seniors and a community center for the people of swansea and we will have done so without raising taxes its up to the voters on aug 18th to determine if they concur
2136 i gave them the bare minimum of 580 000 with a lot of side options they chose not to do like painting improved floor covering elevator and others
2137 then the committee started kicking around why not put in an elevator and why not replace the sprinklers and here we are

2139 stealing cash stealing economic value is a crime its a crime in every system i know of taking property thats not yours thats a crime but when were dealing with virtual property that question might get a little more sophisticated how do we know whats somebodys and whats not somebody elses
2140 particularly if there is a set of algorithms or rules in the game that everything is free for the taking that might is right so we have to be very careful about terms like stealing because stealing might be clearly illegal clearly criminal and thats nothing new weve done that for millennia or it might be part of the gameplay at which point it is not illegal its encouraged as part of the overall interrelationships between the residents of the environment
2141 there is no one single approach taken by the providers of the virtual environments some virtual worlds such as second life were designed to include a minimum amount of governance residents of these worlds were expected to establish their community behavioral norms other virtual worlds include strong governance and control in these worlds such as the provider of the environment sets and enforces clear rules for behavior
2142 these are things that people can or cannot do to each other based on the way the virtual world operator has designed their environment violating these rules is simply impossible because the gameplay doesnt allow it to occur the code doesnt function that way
2143 who governs virtual world environments they are governed by criminal laws governed by torts governed by the virtual world providers rules and they are governed by social norms
2144 its a joint responsibility everyone provides a piece of the puzzle we have our criminal system that provides a piece of the puzzle our judicial system that enforces torts that provides a piece of the puzzle we have our virtual world provider and then the community itself does its own enforcement and that is a piece of the puzzle its a shared responsibility and it would be a mistake to focus on only one aspect
2145 congress has said for the most part they are not responsible for policing their own environments its totally up to them to decide how little or how much they want to do they might decide they want to make their world a police state and will regulate users interactions with each other very tightly 47 usc 230 says they can do that and they are not liable for the way they execute that philosophy
2146 similarly they can say were going to have a lawless environment and 47 usc 230 says if they want to do that they are still not responsible when people engage in bad behavior toward one another
2147 there are numerous gatekeepers in the virtual world safeguarding against numerous types of inappropriate behavior
2148 in second life for instance gatekeepers include our payment and credit card partners and our fraud and risk teams who guard against credit card fraud money laundering and phishing they also include our own governance team the g team which investigates abuse reports and guards against inappropriate content against teens on the adult grid etc and in many cases they include our own users who protect the space and land they inhabit
2149 as with any online community there are occasionally those who seek to disrupt others enjoyment but were able to effectively deal with any repeat disruptors by increasing the severity of the ban up to and including permanently terminating accounts
2150 virtual worlds that incorporate content that is inappropriate for minors generally require users to declare that they are old enough to participate most worlds that allow adult content provide clear warnings concerning the content
2151 avatars are not people they cannot be assaulted sexually or otherwise the one or two reports of sexual assault on avatars cannot be regarded as actual cases of assault any more than a description of an assault in a book or enacted in a play can be construed as being an actual assault

2161 i do have to ask my opponent is that the best you can do is that what this election is really all about is that worthy of the american people
2162 has failed the american people on energy and that failure has led directly to our current crisis
2163 thats how america is going to free itself from our dependence on foreign oil not through short term gimmicks but through a real long term commitment to transform our energy sector

2170 there is no point voting labour any more there are no safe labour seats
2171 they will lose every by election they fight in this parliament and at the next general election they will lose in their heartlands to the liberal democrats a labour vote is now a wasted vote
2172 the truth is there are huge parts of the country where they havent got a hope
2173 not even a single elected councillor in newcastle sheffield manchester liverpool or oxford let alone an mp places where only the liberal democrats can defeat labour
2174 this is a huge opportunity for us weve got to seize it so im shifting our resources to put more campaigners and more effort into those seats where were taking on labour
2175 ive instructed our campaigns chief chris rennard to step up our campaigns in the 50 seats where were best placed to beat labour
2176 well be launching a special fundraising drive for those constituencies in the autumn and i hope youll help
2177 you never know how quickly things will change gordon brown may find the guts to call the general election we should have had last year

2181 the wind comes over the hill and it blasts down these valleys we get more wind up here than they get in the bottom of the pohangina valley

2192 i saw pearl jam at madison square garden last night it was incredible
2193 i know that im endangering my life and am even liable to lose my father but i hope that hell understand this and that god will give him and my family patience and willingness to open their eyes to jesus and to christianity maybe one day ill be able to return to palestine and to ramallah with jesus in the kingdom of god
2194 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews they believe that tradition says that the prophet muhammed fought against the jews and that therefore they must continue to fight them to the death
2195 i hope my father and family open their eyes to jesus and the kingdom of god
2196 a surgical internship of the type we are hosting provides training that is the equivalent of a phd it takes just as much time and effort but provides a different pathway to high end skills
2197 last year the rough here was almost out of control this year the rough is very average and its part of an experiment theyre doing theyre trying to see if the rough height has any effect on scoring
2198 im not saying its playing easy but the rough is not nearly as thick as it was last year
2199 you fall in love with a golf course when you have a setup thats as wonderful as this

2202 its got length its got rough its got tough greens so you need to be on your game
2203 as i decided to put in some time and some work it certainly has made me gain a lot more desire to show my family who i am as a golfer

2205 ive said for quite some time ive been playing quite well and not getting anything out of it
2206 i went there to royal birkdale feeling very good about my golf and i played quite well in very trying conditions for four days and took a lot out of it
2207 weve taken this action as a prudent response to the current extraoridnary market conditions that have resulted in higher than usual redemptions in the fund not matched by fresh investment
2208 because property is a long term investment and the assets are not immediately realisable these types of provisions are common to these types of funds to ensure that the interests of investors are protected during periods of market volatility
2209 in the current market where investors are looking to reduce their exposure to property investments we believe we are acting in the best interests of investors by temporarily suspending activity to preserve the quality of the fund
2210 people are going to write hateful stuff about me and thats fine with me good rounds and low scores can solve everything
2211 news scores amp more on your cell phone get it now
2212 i always thought i would play about five years and have a couple of kids and retire
2213 im kind of unique i really love the game and i go out and play for fun i think with annika its a lot of hard work every time she tees it up shes expected to win her work ethic is just grind grind work out hit balls
2214 i dont think annika could come out here and finish 15th on the money list and live with herself me im ok with that i enjoy what i do i love playing golf but its not the end of the world for me
2215 i play 16 to 18 tournaments a year and get the rest off
2216 and i like what i do so i just play im not sure that im going to play next year but i have plans to finish out this year and then im going to re evaluate and see but im getting close

2219 we called the police my wife was afraid he was going to get ran over or hit
2220 he looked a little agitated but other than that he didnt look to be falling down drunk or anything like that
2221 according to the doctors all injuries are consistent with a fall
2222 they tested his system he was clean of drugs and alcohol we dont know why unless just being in shock and the whole thing in itself caused him to forget everything
2223 im not an officer but i dont see the reason for tasering somebody laying there with a broken back i dont consider that a threat
2224 the tasering increased his white blood cell count and caused him to have a temperature so they could not go into the operation
2225 he refused to comply with the officers and so the officers had to deploy their tasers in order to subdue him he is making incoherent statements hes also making statements such as shoot cops kill cops things like that so there was cause for concern to the officers
2226 its a big concern for the officers to keep this guy out of traffic to keep him from getting hurt
2227 this lethal disturbance in the heart rhythm was precipitated by the agitated state and associated stress as well as the use of the conducted energy weapon taser designed for incapacitation through electro muscular disruption
2228 where have all the most appealing men gone married young most of them and sometimes to women whose most salient characteristic was not their beauty or passion or intellect but their decisiveness

2267 lo que nos dej sin figuras adem s recibimos al iddf hace muy poco tiempo y no dio oportunidad de pensar en algo mejor
2268 pero es mejor dejarlo todo como est y seguir con el apoyo como gobierno lo que ya estaba estructurado por la administraci n pasada
2269 el llamado a la selecci n es algo muy especial que me deja muy contento es como un sue o que uno tiene desde chico ser jugador profesional jugar en un equipo grande jugar una final ganarla llegar a la selecci n jugar un mundial
2270 creo que todos de ni os tuvimos ese sue o y hoy tengo la posibilidad de estar en la selecci n y espero aprovecharla
2271 no me gusta hacer comparaciones l hugo s nchez ha logrado cosas muy importantes con pumas a mi este equipo me ha hecho crecer como jugador y como persona y l ha logrado sus primeros dos campeonatos con pumas y ahora llega para m el llamado a la selecci n
2272 yo siempre voy a respetar a los cr ticos que est n en contra a lo mejor esto pasa much simo en europa y se ve como algo m s normal mientras en m xico todav a hay mucha cr tica con los naturalizados
2273 yo voy a tratar de trabajar tratar de dar lo mejor en pro de la selecci n
2274 eso no cabe aqu saber si es necesario uno o m s creo que el jugador que vaya a la selecci n debe creer en el trabajo que se va a hacer y pensar que est en una selecci n muy importante a nivel mundial debe pensar en tratar de ir a la selecci n sin importar los nombres
2275 un indicativo de que hay competencia en la cancha y que l va a pelear por un puesto y me parece excelente
2276 platicamos muy seguido estamos en contacto con l ojal se quede muchos a os m s hay que ir viendo como se desarrolla el torneo tenemos tiempo para ver como evolucionan las cosas
2277 lo que se busca es ganar campeonatos y tener a los mejores jugadores mexicanos o extranjeros si la visi n que tienen otros equipos es de vender futbolistas es la suya nosotros queremos ganar campeonatos y tener lo mejor
2278 se negoci en el draft con puebla no se present con el equipo y para nosotros ese tema est muerto
2279 en lo que respecta a cruz azul todos sab amos que hay torneos importantes y que se report el equipo pensando en posible convocatoria y en la cantidad de partidos que iban a ver y parece algo raro por la cifra de jugadores que constantemente han sido llamados y que han sido pieza importante en la selecci n
2280 parece que en este momento le est n dando prioridad a los equipos para que puedan contar con plantel completo y en su momento seguramente habr bastantes convocados de este equipo
2281 lo m s bonito y que todo jugador quiere es estar en la selecci n y despu s competir en un mundial en este momento los clubes estar n agradecidos porque no se llevan a sus jugadores y pr ximamente habr oportunidad para que est n en la selecci n
2282 uno quisiera partirse en dos estar con la selecci n y con tu equipo porque son partidos importantes pero esas son decisiones que fueron tomadas por la gente de la federaci n y del cuerpo t cnico de la selecci n y no queda m s que acatar rdenes
2283 me da gran alegr a que haya sido convocado l leandro augusto porque es un gran jugador y uno de mis grandes amigos es un jugador que casi toda su carrera la ha hecho aqu y que ha rendido con creces creo que es un premio al esfuerzo y dedicaci n de toda su carrera
2284 est donde est uno debe tratar de responder yo esperaba la convocatoria y llegaron a un acuerdo la directiva de cruz azul y la fmf que les convenga tanto al equipo como a los jugadores
2285 uno est bien y a gusto trabajando y ahora que viene este torneo hay que tratar de ganarlo
2286 lo nico que queremos aclarar es que hubo una propuesta de galatasaray de turqu a y es una oferta que tanto al jugador como para el club no es satisfactoria es a pr stamo cosa que no creemos sea la manera adecuada para el equipo y para ochoa
2287 estamos en la mejor disposici n de revisar propuestas y evaluarlas cuando tengamos algo que tanto al jugador como al club le llene el ojo vamos a tomar una decisi n
2288 pero sabemos de su inquietud tenemos que respetar su desarrollo profesional vamos a evaluar todo lo que llegue y lo vamos a apoyar en todo lo que se pueda hacer pero la idea es que cumpla su contrato hasta el 2010
2289 es atractivo pero no a pr stamo no es lo que queremos el equipo ni yo uno trabaja para conseguir cosas importantes y no estarse regalando creo que el futbolista mexicano debe darse su lugar y saber valorarse
2290 estoy muy tranquilo porque s que con el apoyo de la directiva siempre ha estado en la mejor de las disposiciones siempre se ha platicado acerca del tema siempre se va a acceder cuando sea algo que conviene a ambas partes

2377 its learning of it at almost the last minute that i think is destabilising the international media and certainly embarrassing for me as up till 48 hours ago i was insisting it would be free and uncensored internet access
2378 weve noticed that the words being used by bocog have changed in recent months from uncensored to what is more like convenient and timely or convenient and available these are quite different words
2379 nevertheless no one has come out publicly and said on behalf of bocog or the ioc sorry but there are certain internet websites which are blocked

2410 taking the brand of a respected hero and diminishing him to a tabloid stalker type obsessed with a popularity they themselves will never have while blaming the person for his own status with no recognition just why that status has been bestowed by some people not everyone but the more they tell people not to like him the more petty and dishonest they reveal themselves to be especially after announcing they valued debating the issues with the public not debating q ratings with the glitterati

2428 what we are saying is that it organizations adopting blades need to be prepared for further changes in this technology

2444 well it gives me hope that mr garrett is prepared to make what are at times difficult decisions
2445 the difference may well be though in the instance of the traveston crossing dam hes dealing with his mates in the queensland labor government

2458 the executives current claim of absolute immunity from compelled congressional process for senior presidential aides is without any support in the case law

2590 this is one of the publishing sensations of the decade we expect to triple our circulation
2591 we were able to restore function in these animals not by dosing them with estrogen but by enabling them to use the estrogen that was naturally present in their bodies
2592 we discovered that you can affect the estrogen receptor directly in the hippocampus right where its needed to address memory and spatial learning
2593 estrogen may act as a growth agent for cancer but in the brain it appears to maintain health and counteract stress
2594 we wanted to come back and enhance the signaling pathway that makes estrogen functional we used a gene therapy technique that enables us to target the brain but ultimately there could be a pharmaceutical that enhances the signaling pathway solely in the brain
2595 this research shows that when the estrogen receptor alpha is restored to adult mice that have been missing it their entire lives it is still possible to enhance memory and learning
2596 this is good news for moving forward to develop clinical interventions and therapeutics because it appears critical damage was not done to brain circuitry during early development there has also been debate about which of at least two estrogen receptors is key to synaptic health clearly estrogen receptor alpha plays a critically important role in hippocampal organization and function
2597 investigating the impact of genetically replacing the estrogen receptor at the cellular synaptic and behavioral levels is a scientific tour de force which provides a strong foundation for the role of estrogen receptor alpha in mediating estrogen action in the hippocampus to restore select types of memory function
2598 from a technology perspective their technique to transfect the estrogen receptor is an exciting advance for researching steroid receptors in the brain
2599 the research brings up the idea that local activation of non nuclear estrogen receptor alpha is important for regulating memory processes in the hippocampus

2616 this study is significant because previous findings have been contradictory and the present investigation includes the largest number of heart attacks in an elderly group to date
2617 our findings make a persuasive case that adiponectin is in fact associated with an increase in heart disease risk in older persons
2618 this study shows that this abundant product of fat cells is a marker and perhaps even a mediator of worsened outcomes in persons aged 65 years and older
2619 further studies should target this protein to unravel the mechanisms responsible

2626 we found a disproportionately high association between living close to a highway and birth complications among affluent mothers
2627 among affluent mothers who live within 200 metres of a highway the odds of delivering an infant with low birth weight increase by 81 percent while their odds of delivering a preterm baby increase by 58 percent compared to mothers who dont live anywhere close to expressways
2628 advantaged mothers may be more susceptible to highway pollution possibly because they have been protected from other hazards present in low income neighbourhoods
2629 we found a disproportionately high association between living close to a highway and birth complications among affluent mothers

2632 there has been a lot of interest in scaling down optical devices
2633 its really a very simple geometry and i was surprised that no one had come up with it before
2634 previously if you wanted to transmit light at a smaller scale you would lose a lot of energy along the path to retain more energy youd have to make the scale bigger these two things always went against each other
2635 now this work shows there is the possibility to gain both of them
2636 we are pulling optics down to the length scales of electrons
2637 and that means we can potentially do some things we have never done before

2676 we were looking for ways to speed up and simplify our refund process and provide better services to our student population
2677 higher one was the only solution that addressed every issue we were trying to address guaranteed bank accounts for all students including those who might otherwise be considered un bankable the ability for students to make their own choices regarding their refunds and manage those choices seven days a week if they so desire
2678 the college did not want to take on banking functions also an in house ach program would not have allowed us to provide for our students with no bank accounts
2679 i get some critiques but theyre also good with the praise
2680 as we anticipate the election of a visionary president of these united states in november we must be keenly aware of the need to send to the congress men and women who share the vision of the president and the platform from which attempts will be made to enact laws and establish policies
2681 we believe jim martin candidate for the u s senate and consistent democrat meets that standard and shares that vision we cannot afford to send to the senate a zig zag so called conservative bush supporter who by his own admission not only voted for bush one time but after having an opportunity to review his leadership for a quadrennium voted for him a second time
2682 this suggests that the flu vaccine doesnt protect seniors as much as has been thought
2683 if you dont account or identify all of these people its easy to overestimate the results
2684 the next step is to find complementary things that can be done such as hand washing or continuing to vaccinate people who come into contact with seniors
2685 we dont have data to say which one way complements best but from the scientific side theres been a lot of talk of what the next step should be
2686 in the past five years it has really come into its own

2698 its a point of distinction for the island to have anne
2699 without her it would be a beautiful island on the northeast coast of canada desperately trying to find a point of distinction
2700 a lot of islanders quite frankly are anned to death
2701 many islanders have had it up to here with anne
2702 you cant go to a wedding without moonshine being in the punch
2703 after theyve seen anne and had their lobster supper whats there to come back for we looked at what is captivating about the seemingly ordinary
2704 if im to be dragged at annes chariot wheels the rest of my life ill bitterly repent having created her

2708 highlight the quality of our integrated business model and disciplined investment approach
2709 this is the second straight quarter production came in below expectations investors are going to be questioning when they can turn that around
2710 you really hope to see them not turn so much of a profit
2711 im all for making a profit its the american way but its another thing to gouge
2712 given todays strong market incentive for expanding exploration and production we can only believe that reinvesting your vast profits into the production of more oil and natural gas in the united states is a profitable strategy that will help our country decrease its dependence on foreign oil
2713 the oil and natural gas industry is massive because it has to be to effectively compete for global energy resources
2714 the industrys earnings make possible the huge investments necessary to help ensure americas future energy needs are met
2715 i got calls telling me i was a piece of crap
2716 i got text messages telling me i hope you blow out your knee
2717 i need to stand up for what i know is right
2718 it never wore on me those guys are a bunch of idiots
2719 but when i left ohio state was the only school i ever considered
2720 youre not going to let justin go to ohio state are you
2721 you dont let him go to ohio state tell him where to go
2722 that was definitely something in the back of my mind
2723 hes a first class guy and down to earth coach bollman is the same way
2724 one of the toughest things ive ever done was telling coach tressel i was going to michigan i loved those guys so much and had become so close
2725 i said youre not going to be a mike boren youre a different kind of kid i dont care if you play football or not what i care is if you do it youve got to give 110 percent
2726 but he grew up as a michigan person and responded well to coach carr and his staff
2727 players want to be coached and have somebody take them to a different level than they can take themselves
2728 you think youre giving it your all but your coach knows what you can do and what you can offer
2729 boren got yelled at like everybody else even though his dad played for bo
2730 was it my first choice hell no but i could have gotten acquainted
2731 when i get done with college football ill let it out
2732 my real friends are still my friends there just arent many of them
2733 ill always root for justin but ill never root for ohio state
2734 tressel and his staff coach with class and emphasize education
2735 they put whats most important first each player is important theres no bashing of players youre not going to be belittled each player has feelings they treat each person with respect
2736 he plowed all the way until sunday and then drove back up to michigan
2737 i was hoping rodriguez would keep some of his assistants
2738 as soon as i got my release papers i contacted ohio state and they welcomed me with open arms
2739 attn nfl justin boren is a quitter who could not handle the system
2740 he thrives on that the more michigan boos him the harder hell work
2741 it will be the happiest day of my life its going to be crazy thats what im looking forward to and its all the better its in ann arbor

2746 since the earth has survived massive meteors like the one that created the gulf of mexico massive volcanic eruptions that spewed millions of tons of ash into the atmosphere and incredibly large fires that charred millions and millions of acres and spewed tons of carbon into the atmosphere is man really capable of destroying the planet by burning the oil and coal that is in the planet
2747 is earth going to stay in its extremes or have a steady norm in weather paterns
2748 there have been several periods of either significant warming or cooling over that last couple of thousand years
2749 if she did know she never would have auditioned for him
2750 for me its part of the closure its part of the healing process for us and to come a support the other families who are here families who lost their children
2751 i was in nothing but a bra and panties and wearing these high heels when everything started shaking
2752 i kind of stopped and looked around to see if it was just me if i was the one shaking or if i was just positioned funny
2753 but then i saw the photographer shaking and all the lights shaking
2754 scientists and researchers in climate and related fields economists policymakers and busin the polar bears are all right
2755 since the earth has survived massive meteors like the one that created the gulf of mexico massive volcanic eruptions that spewed millions of tons of ash into the atmosphere and incredibly large fires that charred millions and millions of acres and spewed tons of carbon into the atmosphere is man really capable of destroying the planet by burning the oil and coal that is in the planet

2759 dchhs is actively involved in the investigation of cases of diarrahal illnesses that may be associated with spray parks in dallas county
2760 it became apparent that the board had a there was just a lack of confidence and quite frankly a lack of trust
2761 if the board doesnt trust my motives and doesnt trust my intentions then its time for me to leave
2762 every person in a public position when theyre leaving an organization is offered some amount of severance so its not at all uncommon for this industry or quite rankly for any public industry
2763 you serve for 23 years its within the legal rights of the contract to give her severance pay
2764 i thank the board for their integrity in doing so if you ask me she deserved more
2765 overall id like to think that the families that we serve appreciated the work of the housing authority as a whole and my contribution as a person
2766 i was the one who actually helped her move her stuff out of the church
2767 we are not going to draw the church into this by any means
2768 we want to talk to mcfarlands friends period they truly were probably her second family down there
2769 there reasoning may be they dont have the nationwide sales but we would be able to sell them pretty easily here in utah
2770 i think its kind of stupid because they are good enough to make the team they should make jerseys for everyone whatever the reason
2771 maybe they are just not as well known as others
2772 hold that cable car up there with pride i gotta ride ride ride
2773 this handbook is not about quick and dirty short term fixes to immediate tactical problems it is about long term strategy a strategy for returning america to its progressive ideals all over america progressives are finding their voices we hope this handbook will help you find yours this book is not about winning and losing elections it is about winning and losing hearts and minds
2774 griffin put the car into reverse running over the victim
2775 griffins family is bad shape and mine will never be the same no matter what they do to him frank had police training he knew how to be safe i dont know how he could have gotten into that predicament if i could make it better for either family i would
2776 the defendants actions were outrageous and the charges reflect that
2777 he came in two years ago as to race and he became a friend
2778 i feel sorry for president nixon he must have had a very unhappy childhood why else would he want to bomb all those cambodians
2779 youd like to remember it that way wouldnt you but ill bet you werent all that rational when you were a teenager
2780 yes well i guess that is an unfortunate consequence of doing what is right nevertheless we must stoically push on and continue to do what we believe is right
2781 peaceful agenda conservative as in frugal not wasteful economic policy
2782 informed intelligent beneficient approach to being all that we can be
2783 we came for training i certainly wont but he will for sure
2784 an injustice anywhere is an injustice everywhere an injustice to anyone is an injustice to everyone
2785 things are only going to change when theres an alliance of values and of communities
2786 hopefully if its successful well bring in another website and i will be in charge of the mens division
2787 when you say that its very polished its funny because thats my aesthetic also so it blends very well with kink com
2788 im trying to bring in huge porn stars big names and also im trying to discover new talent and were going to mix it all together im getting the muscle boys the porn stars the boy next door the gym boy the leather boy the fetish boy im getting all types of men for the site
2789 these are big time porn stars and i love working with them
2790 but i also love working with tober who has been doing it for so long hes on cruise control so i dont have to do much with him hes got skills and i just let him run with it
2791 chad is a top in vanilla porn so he has that dominant streak inside of him already
2792 all it takes from me is to show him the correct way of using a flog or a belt and to hit safely we have safety lessons before we start thats all it took and he went with it thats my job to bring out the sm and the sadistic side of these tops
2793 theres nothing like it on the web so theyre just starving for this material
2794 id like to make it so that it has something for everyone the vanilla crowd who has never thought of bondage or sm but say you know im not really into that but that looks fucking hot
2795 this is san francisco where all the leather boys are and i want to bring in the leather community and embrace the leather community to be a part of kinkmen com and give me some feedback so it can be something for them also
2796 a place for them to for to and have discussions hopefully i can have meetings here in the armory for the leather community that theyll be happy with
2797 i cant believe that theyre paying me for this i pinch myself every morning because its just like a dream job for me
2798 everybody at kink is extremely supportive and i have total freedom and they support my artistic endeavors
2799 i am so excited about my first film with private as they are the biggest name in adult
2800 i am in every scene of the movie which is quite unusual and also why it is called 100 zuleidy it was great fun to make and i made many new friends i hope to do many more films with private in the future
2801 i dont count all the feathers i just count the number of wings
2802 it was a close family that didnt deserve this end i dont have a blood relationship with this family but we have been close for years
2803 this is the most intricate install that weve ever done no seriously
2804 with manny in the middle of the lineup it will certainly get other peoples attention it is not going to be easy in pitchers minds to get through this lineup
2805 its disappointing losing without getting broken but its not the first player it has happened to especially to a guy like ivo
2806 he served really well so it was always going to be a hard match
2807 theres always danger in tough matches against ivo i knew that from the start
2808 i guess ill analyze and assess my game after the us open for the moment its just all a blur i mean its so many tournaments in a row big tournaments in a row its hard
2809 its a tough trip weve got up in front of us now going back to china and coming back to the open
2810 im looking forward for the next two tournaments those are really the ones that can make this season from a good one to a great one again i hope i can manage to pull off something in the next couple of weeks
2811 i dont know what to take out of this match
2812 theres always going to be a nothing match these type of matches what are you going to do i just tried to serve well
2813 it wasnt an olympics or a us open so i can live with that
2814 maybe i got a little bit unlucky on a couple but he definitely served well in the last tiebreaker when i had three chances on second serves i wasnt able to get one when i really needed to be on even terms with him
2815 i guess that cost me the match which is hard to accept
2816 hes doing well and i have done well in the past as well
2817 this year was hard i guess with the start of the year but nevertheless i still think its been a good year i just hope i can show it now at the olympics and the us open
2818 i havent played against top 10 players so much in my career so beating one of them gives me more confidence
2819 were right back in it weve just got to go hard again in the morning
2820 i was just chuntering it was just an aimless rant i think i went in to see him afterwards and i apologised it was just emotion i went in and shook his hand and were friends again
2821 yorkers are probably a bit under used at times i tried to slip a few in and it seemed coming out of the committee room windows they struggled to see them
2822 i dont think the light was an issue it was the dark windows above the sightscreen it was really just the yorkers
2823 with the amount of movement there still is off the wicket it makes life tough for the batsmen i think there is going to movement throughout the game
2824 if we can get a hundred ahead hopefully our bowlers can get the ball in the right areas like fred flintoff did
2825 having icc language in the text sends the wrong message to a man who has presided over genocide
2826 it is likely that we will discuss this the deferral request again over the coming months
2827 but the focus now should be on renewing the unamid mandate and showing solid council support for what is a very different mission in the field
2828 we hope this resolution will get the broadest possible support
2829 to pledge and contribute the helicopter aerial reconnaissance ground transport engineering and logistical units and other force enablers required
2830 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
2831 theres no place in this campaign for that theres no place for it and we shouldnt be doing it
2832 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name
2833 this is a race about big challenges a slumping economy a broken foreign policy and an energy crisis for everyone but the oil companies
2834 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
2835 we think the tenor of his campaign is unlikely to change that is what he is offering voters increasingly harsh character attacks personal attacks while people are out there struggling every day
2836 i think voters did expect different from john mccain it is clear what they are going to be offering the american people over the next 96 days selling voters short
2837 if you came out here with us youd see that we have supportive crowds who really ask us about the issues
2838 when the wintu goes up the river the hills are to the west the river to the east and a mosquito bites him on the west arm when he returns the hills are still to the west but when he scratches his mosquito bite he scratches his east arm
2839 design is a waste of time we have a really ugly site
2840 we are not worried about the design well outsource it or use a free wordpress theme let us focus more on the product
2841 this is almost like once you accuse someone of racism and bigotry the facts become irrelevant
2842 i think that they played the race card on me and we now know from memos from the campaign and everything that they planned to do it all along i was stating a fact and its still a fact
2843 would use his race to scare up votes for john mccain
2844 we know what kind of campaign theyre going to run theyre going to try to make you afraid
2845 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black hes got a feisty wife
2846 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
2847 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
2848 it seems clear therefore that the race card has become a permanent part of obamas hand a wild card to be played whenever the spirit or the circumstances so moves him
2849 itll not only tell them the rating but it will pull of the data that went into it what were the taks passing rates what were the middle school dropout rates what where the high school completion rates
2850 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
2851 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
2852 the olympiad cycle was a very simple four year cycle and you dont need a sophisticated instrument like this to calculate it it took us by huge surprise when we saw this
2853 but the games were of such cultural and social importance that its not unnatural to have it in the mechanism
2854 as we continue to refine our search algorithms to deliver more relevant results we strive to be as open as possible about how we use data to improve your search experience
2855 this new feature doesnt change anything at all about how you search on google and the results you get it just gives you more of a behind the scenes look at how we customize your search experience
2856 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
2857 i think they should probably be a little less paranoid about parsing every word we say and a little more focused on actually addressing the challenges that americans expect the president of the united states to take on
2858 but its deeply unfair to suggest his criticism of obama was race based was a force for unity in this country on this subject every american should be proud of his record as both a governor and president but we knew it was coming in our direction because they did it against a president of the united state of their own party
2859 i think the mccain camp watched our primary on the democratic side very carefully and they know that any accusation of racial divisiveness can be very very harmful for a candidates prospects
2860 we werent suggesting in any way he was using race as an issue
2861 its ridiculous its offensive and you have to wonder if there is a double motive for it
2862 we are compelled to respond tomorrow if he does not do it again we will not talk about it again
2863 for a guy who has actually been the victim of attacks like this with his daughter in south carolina thats unacceptable
2864 i believe the mccain camp recognizes they need to define obama and knock him on his heels every single day
2865 its the first time in a while and he doesnt like it
2866 these are the politics of nixon and atwater its transparent its indecent and its most of all its a sign of desperation
2867 i assume this is what passes for cleverness in the hapless mccain campaign that they think somehow it seems less racist to call obama a racist
2868 the only way he gets to that inject race into the campaign
2869 this is the first time in a generation that the council has considered building homes which marks a major shift in strategy and defining council housing in the 21st century
2870 i hope the people of edinburgh will be reassured that their council is responding to the obvious difficulties many of them face in finding a home

2872 you said that negotiating with iran is pointless and then you went further you said that it was appeasement were you referring to senator barack obama
2873 you know my policies of hyper partisanship hypocrisy and lying my a off in public havent changed but evidently the political calendar has people need to read the speech you didnt get it exactly right either what i when i said that a dictatorship would be a hell of a lot easier as long as i was the dictator and when you know a leader of iran says that they want to destroy israel youve got to take those words seriously or when a leader of the most powerful nation in the world says ill be long gone before some smart person ever figures out what happened inside this oval office and if you dont take them seriously then it harkens back to a day when we didnt take other words seriously it was fitting that i talked about not taking the words of adolf hitler seriously on the floor of the knesset but i also talked about the need to defend israel the need to not negotiate with the likes of al qaeda hezbollah and hamas and the need to make sure iran doesnt get a nuclear weapon
2874 as nazi tanks crossed into poland in 1939 an american senator declared lord if only i could have talked to hitler all of this might have been avoided we have an obligation to call this what it is the false comfort of appeasement which has been repeatedly discredited by history
2875 repeatedly youve talked about iran and that you dont want to see iran develop a nuclear weapon how far away do you think iran is from developing a nuclear capability
2876 you know richard i dont want to speculate and theres a lot of speculation iraq and mushroom clouds appearing above american cities in forty five minutes but one thing is for certain we need to prevent them from learning how to enrich uranium and i have made it clear to the iranians that there is a seat at the table for them if they would verifiably suspend their enrichment and if not well continue to rally the world to isolate them
2877 we should mention we didnt just wake up on a monday morning and say lets call this a civil war

2884 express opposition for the subterranean alley vacation proposed by conner homes in the junction
2885 the project will impact our ability to do business and will have severe negative economic effets on the businesses in the junction area this impact will be compounded by inhibiting the use of the alley during the proposed construction during this time we will not be able to access parking freely at the rear of the business along the alley way there will be the impact of not having the ability for customers to load and unload in the alley way and access the businesses this also will make it very difficult for deliveries to take place during the construction these daily deliveries are vital to sustaining the business along the alley way
2886 if conner does this itll be the end of the businesses that will be the noose it will kill us
2887 the fire department even told us to paint our address numbers on the alley side because thats their first line of response
2888 this project has for the most part flown under the radar
2889 community input is vital for creating development that complements and is considerate of our community
2890 the korean war was hard fought and a great sacrifice
2891 it is often said a nations greatest treasure are its youth
2892 we commit our youth every time we commit ourselves to war many of that great population of youth perished
2893 it is hard to explain the emotion of the people i was privileged to spend time with to listen to their stories to listen to their understanding of what occurred over there
2894 today we are turning over control of most of the combat forces and most of the combat responsibilities to the south koreans
2895 we are moving from the dmz as a nation to south of the han river its the right thing to do south korea is ready to stand up
2896 i bet theyre just regular graphs with some brass doodads tacked on
2897 i just wasnt seeing the production and when you get in a situation where you dont see the production and youve got a young group of receivers that are emerging i just felt like it was in our best interests to let him go at this point
2898 youve got to do whats right for the team i guess its the right move for the team hopefully it is
2899 i am now really looking forward to the football matches in our home city
2900 we are in the final phase of our preparation and we will enter the olympic tournament in top form
2901 goal scoring remains a problem for our team as we squander too many chances
2902 i hope we can find our goal scoring touch by the time the games begin
2903 i stay put in my position as opposed to running around as much as i did when i first started playing at the age of 17 that is what i have learned to maintain my position and play more with my head
2904 ive mostly played as a central midfielder but i was positioned as centreback several times at osasuna ive adapted well to that position and feel very comfortable
2905 i had the chance to play in some games when i was here last time but a player needs to enjoy some continuity and know that the coach counts on him even when a game doesnt turn out well
2906 i feel ready to play on this team and to have some continuity im here to make decisions hard for the coach

2911 as we mourn his passing so too should we reflect on his contributions to our national security of the thousands of lives he guided the careers he mentored the difference he made simply by virtue of his leadership
2912 we are a stronger more capable military today in large part because of his efforts to make us so he will be missed
